The\nreport highlighted a significant decline in crop yields, with a drop from 206,572 tons harvested in 2021/22 to 125,184 tons in 2022/23.\nCereal production in 2022/23 reached only 67,530 tons, which is equivalent to just 23% of the national requirement. The 2022/23 cropping\nseason experienced low and highly erratic rainfall, along with extended dry periods, severely impacting food and agricultural production,\ndisrupting urban water supplies, and damaging the rural economy and socio-cultural structures. As a result, the nation is experiencing\nsignificant chronic food insecurity, with over 10% of the population facing food and nutrition problems.\nThe country has experienced dry spells and rainfall deficits in recent years, leading the government to declare a drought emergency in\nJuly 2023. This marks the third consecutive year of severe drought, affecting arable agricultural land in a context where 70% of the rural\npopulation depends on agriculture for their livelihoods, primarily through rain-fed farming. Since then, 163,000 people have been\ncategorized as food insecure. The SADC Synthesis Report on The State of Food and Nutrition Security and Vulnerability in Southern Africa\nindicated that 37,000 individuals in Botswana are experiencing food insecurity in 2024.\nThe El Ni\u00f1o drought effect in Southern Africa has further exacerbated the already critical drought situation. According to the Southern\nAfrica Seasonal Monitor report, Botswana is currently experiencing El Ni\u00f1o conditions, leading to severe rain deficits and challenging\nharvest conditions across most of the region, with dry spells expected to persist. In May 2024, the Heads of State from the Southern\nAfrican Development Community (SADC) held an Extraordinary Summit to address the cumulative challenges posed by El Ni\u00f1o-induced\ndroughts and floods, specifically focusing on Botswana. The summit emphasized the impacts of climate change in the region, particularly\nthe effects of El Ni\u00f1o-induced droughts and disasters on the economy, health, water resources, and energy sector. The government of\nBotswana expressed concerns about imminent food and livestock feed shortages due to unfavorable weather conditions impacting crop\nPage 2 / 22\nproduction, predicting a difficult period ahead. Drawing comparisons to the severe droughts of the 1980s, the summit underscored the\npotential for the current situation to replicate that crisis and called for partners to invest in mitigating the situation.\nIn response to the crisis, the Botswana Red Cross has launched a DREF intervention, considering the above context and in response to\nvarious calls for action from the government.\nImpact of heat and dry spells on the crops in Mabutsane area\nImpact of drought in the North-East District\nScope and Scale\n1. Long-standing Drought and Declining Agricultural Production\nThe year 2023 marked the third consecutive year of severe drought in Botswana, with conditions showing no signs of improvement in\n2024 due to the effects of El Ni\u00f1o. Historical data highlights the devastating impact of droughts on vulnerable communities, exacerbating\na steady decline in agriculture over the past decade and compounding challenges in health, education, and economic stability. Despite\ngovernment interventions, the number of food-insecure individuals has remained significant. As of 2024, 37,000 people are facing food\ninsecurity, a figure comparable to previous years: 38,300 in 2019/20, 36,145 in 2020/21, and 36,977 in 2021/22. The SADC Synthesis Report\non The State of Food and Nutrition Security and Vulnerability in Southern Africa 2022/2023 attributes this situation to prolonged dry\nspells, erratic rainfall, and extreme temperatures, which have led to reduced planting acreage and crop failures. These conditions have\nresulted in increased food insecurity and higher rates of underweight children.\n2. Current Period Scale and Projections\nDespite various government interventions, food security in Botswana has worsened, particularly in eastern regions such as Lethakeng,\nHukuntsi, Mabutsane, Shoshong, Boteti, Ghanzi, Okavango, North East, and Molepolole. These areas have been severely affected by food\ninsecurity, malnutrition, and high livestock mortality rates. An April 2024 report from the Department of Crop Production indicated\nsevere crop damage due to extreme heat and low rainfall, particularly in the Kgalagadi, North East, and Central Districts. The May 24,\n2024, report from the Rural Development Secretariat detailed the 2022/23 cropping season's challenges, with total production falling to\n125,184 tons from 206,572 tons in 2021/22. Cereal production reached only 67,530 tons, just 23% of the national requirement, and\ndelayed planting activities have further heightened the risk of food insecurity for rural households.\n3. Worsening Factors and Context Analysis\nThe ramifications of drought extend across nearly all sectors, including agriculture, water, and health. The loss of income from failed\ncrops, livestock mortality, and job loss significantly strains livelihoods. Drought exacerbates the fragile food and agricultural situation,\nseverely disrupting the rural economy and socio-cultural fabric. Approximately 70% of rural households rely on agriculture for their\nlivelihoods, with crop production heavily dependent on rain-fed farming. Rangelands, which cover over 60% of the country and support\nthe livestock industry, are particularly affected by drought. Urban communities face water scarcity, leading to rationing and constraints\non daily activities. Vulnerable populations, including the elderly, the destitute, and children under five, are most affected, with\nmalnutrition often worsening during drought periods. Rising food prices further exacerbate rural communities' vulnerability,\nhighlighting the urgent need for intervention. Many livestock farmers are rushing to sell their cattle to mitigate losses anticipated during\nthe dry winter season.\nThe Department of Meteorological Services' Climate Outlook for 2024 forecasts a hot and dry season from January to April, with potential\nimpacts including decreased river discharge, dam levels, crop yields, pasture degradation, and increased food prices. This outlook\nsuggests a more severe drought compared to previous seasons. With winter approaching, the likelihood of wildfires in this historically\nwildfire-prone region is high. Following consecutive years of drought and extreme temperatures in early 2024, the coming months (June\nPage 3 / 22\nto August 2024) are expected to be cold, with average temperatures between 9\u00b0C and 21\u00b0C, and little to no rain, making July and August\nmostly dry.\nIn response to the crisis, the Botswana Red Cross has launched a DREF intervention, taking into account the above context and\nresponding to various government calls for action.\nSource Information\nSource Name\nSource Link\n1.

From the 2018 flood\nintervention, it was learned that cash is generally the preferred recommendation across different contexts, taking into account the\ndiversity of communities. This finding was further supported by the 2023 food security project funded by Palms of Life. During this\nintervention, some families expressed a need for hygiene items and clothing, especially for school-going children. If cash had been\nused as the distribution method, families could have prioritized their actual needs. Moreover, this approach could reduce logistical\ncosts, allowing more funds to directly benefit the affected individuals.\nIn contrast, in-kind food distribution operates on the assumption that food is the highest priority for those in need. However, this\nmay not always be the case, as different situations affect people differently. It was also learned that while cash provides flexibility to\nmeet various needs, it can risk compromising the intended impact, particularly in cases requiring specialized support, such as\nnutritional supplements for children or effective income-generating activities. Therefore, the National Society learned to balance\nbetween cash and in-kind approaches to mitigate the risk of cash being used for other purposes, which could potentially increase the\nvulnerability of these families. This must be accompanied by a strong Community Engagement and Accountability (CEA) strategy to\nensure the targeted families fully understand the intervention.\nhttps://www.sundaystandard.info/botswana-\nrecords-driest-february-in-40-years/\nhttps://reliefweb.int/report/angola/synthesis-\nreport-state-food-and-nutrition-security-and-\nvulnerability-southern-africa-2022-enpt\nhttps://reliefweb.int/report/botswana/botswana-\nvulnerability-assessment-committee-results-2019\nPage 4 / 22\nCurrent National Society Actions\nStart date of National Society actions\n01-04-2023\nLivelihoods And Basic Needs\nAfter three consecutive years of drought, the government declared a state of emergency\nin July 2023. In support of government initiatives, the National Society (NS) has been\nactively involved in:\nEarly warning efforts:\nProviding support for nutrition and food insecurity response over the past three years,\nthanks to support from ECHO, the government, and NGOs. This support has also led to\ncapacity building for the NS in new approaches to food security and livelihood, including\nsmart agriculture.\nThe Gweta Community Farm has become a vital resource for food security and\nlivelihood enhancement, shedding light on the daily challenges faced by farmers in\nBotswana. The NS has employed two experienced horticulturalists specializing in\nsustainable farming practices to provide guidance to farmers coping with dryness,\nextreme heat, and water scarcity.\nSince 2023, the NS has supported the government in early warning and assessment\nefforts. Through the Palms-funded project, the NS has also provided support for food\npackage distribution in the Okavango District for six months to malnourished children\nunder 5 years old and pregnant and lactating women (PLW). Additionally, a one-time\ncash-for-food assistance was provided to families in the Qanqwa settlement in April\n2024. This allocation is focused on response, with some transitional activities aimed at\ncontributing to medium-term impact.\nHealth\nIn 2023, the National Society implemented a food security project in the Okavango\nDistrict, funded by Palms for Life, targeting malnourished children under 5 years old,\npregnant women, and lactating mothers. This initiative aimed to provide food packages\nfor six months. As part of this effort, a one-time food distribution operation was\nconducted in the Qanqwa settlement in April 2024 to offer much-needed relief to\nhouseholds not covered by government social safety nets. Additionally, nutritional\neducation was provided to the beneficiaries.\nWater, Sanitation And Hygiene\nThe National Society has water tanks in Tsetseng Village to improve access to clean and\nconsistent water supply. This was in partnership with the Coca Cola Foundation and are\ncurrently being refilled by the Government of Botswana.\nProtection, Gender And Inclusion\nIn partnership with IFRC (CBF), the Botswana Red Cross Society is implementing a\nProtection, Gender, and Inclusion project in three districts: Chobe, North East, and\nPalapye, scheduled to conclude in mid-July 2024. The project utilizes various strategies,\nincluding Social and Behavior Change Communication, capacity building, and research.\nAlthough the project is being implemented in different districts, the National Society has\ndeveloped some capacity at the headquarters level and for some members of the\nNational Disaster Response Team (NDRT). This capacity will be beneficial in the\nimplementation of the Protection, Gender, and Inclusion (PGI) approach in this\nintervention, particularly regarding the delivery of key messages on PGI, capacity\nbuilding for staff and volunteers, and research on the root causes of sexual and gender-\nbased violence. These skills will be employed as needed for the intervention.\nEducation\nWith the support of the government, the BRCS continues to provide educational,\nrehabilitation, and stimulation services to children living with disabilities in three key\nareas across Botswana: The Sefhare Stimulation Center in Sefhare, the Tshimologo\nStimulation Center in Francistown, and the Tlamelong Rehabilitation Center in Tlokweng.\nIn 2023, 101 children with disabilities were enrolled across these three centers. The\nTlamelong Rehabilitation Center has enrolled 39 trainees with disabilities, specializing in\nhorticulture and textiles. These centers also provide meals to the learners, ensuring they\nare well-nourished, particularly those from disadvantaged families. Additionally, the\nPage 5 / 22\nTlamelong Rehabilitation Center offers horticultural training, enabling some learners to\nestablish their own gardens and poultry farms.\nRisk Reduction, Climate Adaptation And\nRecovery\nIn 2023, the Botswana Red Cross Society (BRCS) organized Disaster Risk Management\n(DRM) Law workshops to educate government officials on disaster law, specifically\nfocusing on the BRCS Act and National DRM laws. These workshops were part of the\nsensitization efforts for the upcoming BRCS Act review process, reaching a total of 106\ngovernment officials. The National Society Disaster Management Office supported the\ndevelopment of draft legislation to guide the law components. The draft bill, which aims\nto repeal the Red Cross Act of Botswana 1968, is now available for review by relevant\nstakeholders.\nAdditionally:\nThe Netherlands Red Cross Society (NLRCS) has signed a two-year contract with the BRCS\nfollowing extensive engagement in water management and innovation in Botswana.\nBRCS participated in the IFRC Solferino Academy Global Innovation Summit Conference,\nwhere they co-hosted a session with the NLRCS on building active participatory\npartnerships in the humanitarian sector. This session highlighted the BRCS/NLRCS Water\nManagement and Innovation Partnership project as a case study.\nCommunity Engagement And\nAccountability\nThe BRCS has over 13,000 volunteers nationwide. These volunteers receive capacity-\nbuilding mentorship and are provided with sufficient resources to engage with their\ncommunities effectively. Before being deployed for society projects, they undergo\nrefresher training to ensure they communicate project details clearly and facilitate\ncommunity feedback.\nBRCS promotes behavioral and social change across all its programs by using television,\nradio, newspapers, and social media to disseminate information on public health issues,\nfirst aid, SGBV, climate change, and livelihoods. In 2023, BRCS was featured 33 times on\ntelevision, radio, and in newspapers, while maintaining active social media accounts,\nwith their Facebook page having 37.2K followers.\nEnvironment Sustainability\nBRCS has been conducting training sessions for farmers in Gweta on climate-smart\nagriculture and water conservation. Consequently, the National Society is well-equipped\nto extend these training programs to other districts across Botswana.\nCoordination\nThe National Society collaborates closely with several government departments, notably\nthe Ministry of State President - National Disaster Management Office and the Ministry\nof Local Government and Rural Development. These departments are key stakeholders\nin addressing vulnerability, enhancing community resilience, and ensuring food security\nnationwide.\nThe National Society has a multisectoral partnership with government ministries and\ndepartments such as the Ministry of Health and Wellness, Office of the President,\nNational Disaster Management Office (NDMO), Ministry of Local Government and Rural\nDevelopment, Botswana Council for the Disabled, and UN agencies (FAO and UNDP) and\nthe private sector.\nNational Society Readiness\nOver the past three consecutive years of drought in Botswana (since 2020/2021), the\nNational Society (NS) has undertaken projects supported by various donors. These\ninitiatives have contributed to the NS's readiness and capacity strengthening in various\nareas of expertise.\nDespite limited resources, the NS has supported the government in early warning and\nassessment activities, which are ongoing. A report from May 25 provides more\ninformation on areas of gaps and support needed by the government, allowing the NS\nto develop a plan to complement government efforts and scale up action for the\n2023/2024 drought.\nIn terms of cash readiness, the NS established agreements with financial service\nproviders through the ECHO project (2020-2021), gaining valuable experience and\nlessons. The project aimed to improve the food and nutrition security of drought-\naffected, food-insecure households in Ngamiland, Central, and South East Districts of\nBotswana through the provision of food and livelihood assistance.\nPage 6 / 22\nBRCS staff and volunteers have received training on disaster response, Cash and\nVoucher Assistance (CVA), and Protection, Gender, and Inclusion (PGI), which are critical\nfor the successful implementation of the proposed DREF.\nThe NS has also collaborated with the Netherlands Red Cross Society to strengthen\ncapacity building and information management.\nFurthermore, training and experience in IFRC emergency operation and cash assistance\nwere facilitated and organized by IFRC.\nAssessment\nSince the declaration of drought in 2023, assessments have been continuously\nconducted. An updated assessment report was released on May 24, 2024, which\ninformed the request for intervention. The National Society continues to monitor the\nsituation. Currently, the government, in collaboration with the National Society, is\nconducting a comprehensive assessment to determine the impact of drought in the\ncountry. The results of this assessment are expected to be released in June or July 2024.\nIFRC Network Actions Related To The Current Event\nSecretariat\nThe International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is actively\nengaged in providing technical support to monitor the current situation. Working closely\nwith the National Society, the IFRC remains vigilant in monitoring developments. This\ntechnical assistance highlights the IFRC's commitment to supporting disaster response\nefforts and strengthening community resilience. By participating in early warning\ninitiatives and maintaining continuous monitoring, the IFRC aims to ensure that\ncommunities are well-informed and prepared to respond effectively to evolving crises.\nThis proactive approach is in line with the IFRC's mission to alleviate human suffering\nand promote the well-being of vulnerable populations globally.\nParticipating National Societies\nNetherlands Red Cross Society provides support under the Water Management and\nInnovation Partnership  by providing support to the Gweta Community Farm,\nspecifically in relation to water conservation.  Netherlands Red Cross Society is also\ninvesting on capacity building and information management of BRCS.\nICRC Actions Related To The Current Event\nThere is no ICRC presence in country.\nOther Actors Actions Related To The Current Event\nGovernment has requested international\nassistance\nYes\nNational authorities\nBotswana has established a well-structured drought monitoring and early warning\nsystem, supported by some capacity. This system utilizes drought indices and socio-\neconomic conditions to evaluate drought risk and vulnerability. Following the\ndeclaration of a state of emergency due to drought in July 2023, the government\ninitiated various activities, including early actions. Currently, these early action\ninterventions, such as information dissemination and awareness messaging, are being\nimplemented by the government with the support of the National Society (NS). As a key\nearly action, the Botswana Vulnerability Assessment Committee (BVAC) conducts annual\nlivelihood vulnerability assessments to guide interventions during droughts.\nThe government has also launched response programs to assist the most vulnerable\ncommunities, including support for agricultural production, a nutrition program, and a\nPage 7 / 22\ncomprehensive assessment. The National Drought Assessments will provide insights into\nthe needs of districts affected by drought. Although this report is scheduled for release\naround June or July 2024, initial highlights have already been disseminated by the\ngovernment to encourage action from partners.\nBRCS has been in discussions with the National Disaster Management Office (Ministry for\nState President) and the Rural Development Council (Ministry of Local and Rural\nDevelopment) to identify gaps in current food security initiatives, determine other\nneeds, and address them in the districts most severely affected by the drought.\nUN or other actors\nBRCS has been working in partnership with Palms for Life to provide food security\ninterventions in the Okavango District.\nAre there major coordination mechanism in place?\nThe National Society participates in coordination mechanisms within the National Disaster Management Technical Committee (NDMTC)\nand District Disaster Management Committees (DDMC).\nBRCS collaborates closely with DDMCs, which include the Department of Crop Production, Veterinary Services, Social and Community\nDevelopment, and Water Utilities Corporation, among others. This collaboration involves sharing information on the drought situation\nand working together to conduct assessments.\nNeeds (Gaps) Identified\nLivelihoods And Basic Needs\nAccording to the report from the Rural Development Secretariat under the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development, the\n2022/23 cropping season experienced low and highly variable rains, along with prolonged dry spells.\nLivestock production is a significant activity in both urban and rural areas and is a major industry in the country. Cattle farming is\nwidespread, with cattle outnumbering people by two to one. While this remains a priority activity, it is crucial to note that the drought's\nimpact on cattle activities is significant for small farmers and families who depend on it as a primary source of income or food. The\ndrought, coupled with water scarcity in some areas and inflation of food and input prices, poses challenges for the most vulnerable\nfamilies and small-scale farmers, potentially worsening their food security. Rangelands, covering over 60% of the country and vital for the\ncattle industry, are severely affected by the drought. Many livestock farmers are selling their cattle to mitigate losses incurred and\nanticipated during the upcoming dry winter season.\nAgriculture remains the main source of income for 70% of rural communities (comprising 30% of the population), which are currently\nexperiencing crop failures due to rain deficits and dry spells. Areas such as Lethakeng, Hukuntsi, Mabutsane, Shoshong, Boteti, Ghanzi,\nOkavango, North East, and Molepolole are the hardest hit by food insecurity, malnutrition, and high livestock mortality rates. A report\nfrom the Department of Crop Production in April 2024 highlighted severe damage to crops across the country, especially in the Kgalagadi\n(Hukuntsi and Mabutsane), North East, and Central Districts, which are the hottest regions.\nTotal production for the 2022/23 season stands at 125,184 tons, lower than the 206,572 tons harvested in 2021/22. Cereal production is at\n67,530 tons, representing only 23% of the national requirement. Due to the delayed start of the season, most farmers have not yet begun\nploughing or planting.\nThe grazing situation has significantly deteriorated, with poor conditions reported in areas such as Serowe, Lethakeng, Mabutsane,\nHukuntsi, and Mahalapye. Veld fires have further exacerbated the problem.\nThe severe drought has severely impacted the primary sources of income for both arable and livestock farmers, significantly affecting\ntheir livelihoods and ability to meet basic needs. Livestock farmers are facing acute water and forage shortages, leading to weakened\nanimals and decreased milk production, reducing the value of livestock and forcing farmers to sell their animals to recover funds already\ninvested. Agricultural losses contribute to decreased food production, rising food prices, and increased food insecurity.\nPage 8 / 22\nMulti purpose cash grants\nUnconditional multipurpose cash grants offer immediate financial relief to families and farmers, enabling them to purchase food,\nessential goods, and meet basic needs, ultimately improving food self-sufficiency. BRCS will select a financial service provider for the cash\ndistributions.\nProviding financial assistance through unconditional multipurpose cash grants can offer immediate relief to farmers experiencing\nfinancial difficulties due to crop failures, livestock losses, and lack of basic needs. These funds can help families cover their essential\nneeds, invest in productive assets, and stabilize their livelihoods during challenging times. Volunteers will be involved in assessments,\nbeneficiary registration in the three districts, and post-distribution assessments.\nHealth\nRecent reports from UNICEF Botswana (2023) and the Kgalagadi North District Disaster Risk Management Committee have highlighted\nconcerning levels of malnutrition and food insecurity among children under 5 years old. The data shows high rates of wasting, stunting,\nand underweight, indicating a significant portion of the population is experiencing food insecurity worsened by persistent drought\nconditions. Poor feeding practices and limited access to nutritious food are key factors contributing to the prevalence of malnutrition in\nthe area.\nFurthermore, drought has had adverse effects on mental health, as communities have suffered crop losses, livelihood disruptions, and\nagricultural setbacks. It is crucial that any intervention in this regard supports these affected individuals without inadvertently causing\nharm and ensures they are connected to appropriate resources.\nWater, Sanitation And Hygiene\nMost regions in Botswana have experienced extreme temperatures and minimal rainfall, leading to water scarcity. The prolonged\ndroughts have reduced the frequency of rainfall, resulting in the depletion of surface and groundwater sources.\nBeing a semi-desert country, Botswana relies heavily on limited surface water supplies, with most villages depending on wells, boreholes,\nand dams for water. The lack of rainfall, exacerbated by El Ni\u00f1o conditions, has led to below-average levels in dams and wells, leaving\nvulnerable communities with limited access to safe drinking water. This situation has created competition for water resources among\nhumans, livestock, and wildlife, with the likely consequence of wells, boreholes, and dams drying up during the dry season, which\nextends until October.\nThe Rural Development Secretariat's report highlights that major water supply projects have significantly improved water access in\nseveral villages that previously faced acute shortages. Villages such as Metsimantsho, New Xanagas, Mahotshwane, Makobo, Jamakata,\nNatale, Makopong, Kokotsha, Grootlaagte, Draaihoek, Xhumo, Dimajwe, Itholoke, Ngwatle, Zutshwa, Dibete, Tewane, Toromoja,\nBetesankwe, and Good Hope have transitioned from inadequate to stable water supply.\nDue to limited water sources, priority is given to water for cooking rather than for good hygiene practices like handwashing. The lack of\nproper hand hygiene can lead to health issues such as diarrhea. Therefore, there is a need to promote and educate communities about\nthe importance of hygiene practices.\nProtection, Gender And Inclusion\nIn the context of drought and limited resources, concerns regarding protection, gender, and inclusion become more pronounced,\nespecially for vulnerable populations such as women and children. \nIt is crucial to enhance protection services to prevent and respond to gender-based violence, which tends to increase during operations\nthat provide support in the form of cash.\nCurrently, village leadership is predominantly male, highlighting the importance of ensuring gender equity by considering the specific\nneeds of women and ensuring that aid distribution is fair and inclusive.\nContinued community education on protection, gender, and inclusion (PGI) is necessary, along with training for community volunteers\nwho will be involved in assessments and distributions. PGI training will be integrated with Community Engagement and Accountability\n(CEA) training to address all community needs, incorporate feedback, and ensure that all planned interventions are inclusive and do not\nharm vulnerable communities.\nPage 9 / 22\nEducation\nBotswana Government has successfully managed to operate a school feeding programme that provides one meal a day and reaches all\ngovernment schools. Currently all primary schools are provided with breakfast and mid-day meal including a third meal for school going\nchildren in the remote areas; There are no needs identified in education services.\nRisk Reduction, Climate Adaptation And Recovery\n1. Dry spells and associated disasters in Botswana:\nBotswana, a semi-arid country, faces deforestation challenges, particularly in fragile ecosystems like its dry land forests. The\nindiscriminate harvesting of both woody and non-woody forest components leads to land degradation. According to a report from the\nRural Development Secretariat under the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development, twenty-six districts experienced\nwildland fire outbreaks since the beginning of the fire season, worsening from August to October 2023. Factors such as extremely dry fuel\nload, high temperatures, and windy conditions exacerbated the situation, resulting in a total burnt area of 777,750 hectares (Ha) since\nApril 2023. The Ghanzi District recorded the highest area burnt at 313,661.2 Ha, followed by the Okavango and North East Districts with\n121,273.9 and 113,109.9 Ha, respectively.\nTree planting is a significant nature-based solution that can help offset greenhouse gas emissions, promote biodiversity conservation,\nenhance water retention, and create socio-economic benefits. However, in 2010, Botswana had approximately 4.58 square kilometers of\ntree cover, covering less than 0.1% of its land area. By 2022, it lost 2 hectares of tree cover, equivalent to 1.70 kilotons of CO\u2082 emissions.\nFrom 2001 to 2022, Botswana lost 11 Ha of tree cover to fires and 499 Ha to all other drivers of loss. While tree planting can restore\ndegraded landscapes and enhance ecosystem resilience, it is a long-term solution. Immediate and transitional perspectives need to be\nassessed and prioritized for the upcoming season.\n2. Rainfall forecasts:\nSince the last quarter of 2023, the agricultural season has experienced rainfall failures. According to a Drought Update report dated May\n24, 2024, from the Rural Development Secretariat under the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development, Botswana's rainfall\nseason typically starts in October. Forecasts for the first half of the season (October to December 2023) predict normal to below-normal\nrainfall in the northern and western regions (Ngamiland, Chobe, Ghanzi, and Kgalagadi). Meanwhile, the eastern regions (Northeast,\nCentral, Southeast, Kgatleng, Kweneng, and Southern Districts) are expected to receive below-normal rainfall, with above-normal\ntemperatures expected nationwide. From January to March 2024, most of the country (Ngamiland, North Central, Chobe, Ghanzi,\nKgalagadi, Southern, Southeast, Kgatleng, and Kweneng) is forecasted to experience normal to below-normal rainfall. The extreme\neastern regions are expected to see below-normal rainfall, indicating ongoing challenges with water availability and agricultural\nproductivity. As a result, the season is classified as a meteorological drought year. The report also notes that water supply, especially in\nrural areas, is inadequate, with water levels in major rivers at their lowest. Grazing conditions for livestock have significantly deteriorated\nand are now rated as poor, exacerbated by veldt fires. Some districts are experiencing water scarcity and cases of child malnutrition. The\nBotswana Meteorological Services predict cold temperatures in June to August, with little to no rain, making July and August mostly dry.\nCommunity Engagement And Accountability\nThe Botswana Red Cross Society will ensure community engagement and accountability through several strategies, including establishing\nefficient feedback mechanisms and using the collected data to guide projects. Local authorities will supervise public gatherings to identify\nvulnerable individuals based on established selection criteria. Help desks will be established during all community interactions to\nfacilitate two-way communication and gather feedback. This approach seeks to promote transparency, inclusivity, and responsiveness in\ndelivering assistance and services.\nEnvironment Sustainability\nThe drought in Botswana has severely affected agriculture, resulting in crop failures, livestock losses, and food shortages. It is crucial to\nassist farmers in exploring alternative livelihood options to improve food security and resilience to changing climate conditions.\nCommunity resilience can be strengthened through capacity building, education, and training in drought preparedness and emergency\nresponse strategies. Empowering local communities to adapt to environmental changes is essential for reducing the impact of drought on\nlivelihoods and overall well-being.\nPage 10 / 22\nAny identified gaps/limitations in the assessment\nThe government of Botswana is currently finalizing a comprehensive assessment of all regions in the country, with the report expected to\nbe released between June and July 2024. This assessment will identify gaps and results, determining whether further intervention is\nnecessary to support farmers and communities in coping with the impact of drought during the winter season and the upcoming\nplanting season (October to November 2024).\nDiscussions at the Southern Africa summit emphasized the importance of ongoing annual drought assessments to understand and\nproject the effects of drought on key economic sectors. This assessment may complement the analysis of food insecurity caused by\ndrought in the country.\nOperational Strategy\nOverall objective of the operation\nThe goal of this DREF request is to assist 5,350 individuals (1,070 households) in Hukuntsi, Mabutsane, and the North-East District who are\nfacing challenges related to food insecurity, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), as well as disruptions to their livelihoods. This\nassistance will be provided through sustainable measures, including access to clean water, supplementary feeding for malnourished\nchildren, livestock feed, and multipurpose cash transfers.\nThis operation will span 6 months and will focus on supporting vulnerable and underserved communities with sustainable interventions\nto address their livelihood needs, combat malnutrition in children under 5 years old, improve access to clean water, provide\nmultipurpose cash grants, and promote tree planting.\nOperation strategy rationale\nThe approach is to ensure a comprehensive and multifaceted response strategy to address the immediate and long-term needs of these\ncommunities. These interventions have been carefully designed to provide support to the affected communities during the emergency\nphase and to set the path for transition to next season while further data being collected may inform a revision and early recovery\nconsiderations. \nCurrent emergency phase intervention is informed and designed based on the needs and information from the summary report that was\nreleased on the 24 May 2024 by Rural Development Secretariat under the Ministry of Local Government and Rural development. The\nDREF strategy also consider that Government is already covering the support to agriculture and that other partners are active in country.\nThis intervention will have specific objective to reach the communities in food insecurity and facing drought effects on their livelihood,\nfood and water access but also general wellbeing. Focusing in the localities of Hukuntsi, Mabutsane and the North-East district with\nimmediate humanitarian relief. Strategy details provided below.\nThis DREF will be subject to revision based on season priorities and findings and recommendations expected from the comprehensive\nassessment report to be released by the government in June/July 2024. This report will also guide the interventions to be implemented\nduring the next planting season, from October to December 2024, and will determine if further escalation and resource mobilization are\nneeded to assist the affected districts. The Government report will be shared and if need be, an operation update will be provided. In any\ncase, an update is expected prior the next planting season and will be informed by the data collected by then, feedback from\ncommunities, sub-regional strategic orientations coming out of the ongoing multi-country movement coordination.  \n1.  Health \nThe actions prioritise under health will be to Enhance health risk prevention and wellbeing; strengthen the supplementary Feeding\nPrograms and Promoting Optimal Infant and Young Child Feeding Practices. Those axis will contribute to strengthen the good practices\naiming to reduce the risk of deterioration of wellbeing for families already facing food insecurity and/or having nutrition challenges.\nEspecially for families with health vulnerability criteria such as age groups with specific nutrition consideration, elderly, Pregnant and\nLactation women etc. \n- Strengthen existing supplementary feeding programs targeting 300 households, to ensure that children under 5 years receive nutritious\nmeals that meet their dietary requirements. This is based on the assessment that was conducted by the Ministry of health. Purchasing\nsupplements for malnourished children is a way to ensure that the targeted beneficiaries receive the required supplements for the\nchildren under 5 years and minimizes the probability for some families to buy other items not intended to address the nutritional needs\nof the children.\n- Promoting Optimal Infant and Young Child Feeding Practices will be done by volunteers after appropriate training. The BRCS will ensure\nAssessment Report\nPage 11 / 22\nthat for the time of the operation, the team provide education and support to mothers and caregivers on proper infant feeding practices\nto ensure children receive adequate nutrition during their critical growth periods. This will be possible through visits but there will be an\nextensive dissemination of these messages during the group discussions with mothers, PLW, during the engagement with local\ninstitution, community representatives, head of households. Ensuring the message is streamlined for effective prioritization of good\nnutrition practices. Messages will cover risk of malnutrition, sign of malnutrition, importance of exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6\nmonths and the introduction of complementary foods thereafter. During household food distributions, BRCS volunteers will further\nemphasized on these messages.\n- On the Psychological First Aid and Mental Health Support, BRCS will start by training community volunteers in psychological first aid\ntechniques to provide immediate emotional and psychological support to individuals affected by the impacts of drought, food insecurity,\nand malnutrition. That team will then support the PFA to the communities where needed. Ensuring individuals in need of mental health\nservices are referred to appropriate resources and care providers.\n2.  WASH intervention will be deployed on two priority areas at this stage: Improve access to safe water as an immediate needs and\npromote good hygiene and food hygiene. The aim being to mitigate any worsening factor of the food insecurity situation.\n- For effective water solution and prioritization of the communities that need the most a scale-up of the water access, NS will conduct\nmapping of water sources. That mapping will serve to identify the water sources that need to be repaired and the communities with an\nimportant gaps in terms of water access. Looking into the distance with water point, existing water sources and gaps, ratio of sources and\ncommunities, use of the existing sources identified etc. That analysis will give element for a more relevant installation of the Water tank\nand define where at contrary, there is a need for repairs of existing water sources. \n- This intervention is planned to support communities with 4 water tanks that can sustain them, and livelihoods until the next rainy\nseason which begins in November. Strategically placed water tanks will provide a reliable means to store water during the current dry\nspell and ensure limited disruptions to livelihoods and agricultural activity due to water related challenges. \n- Under this operation, the NS is planning to refurbish 3 water sources in the identified districts for human and livestock consumption as\nwell as cropping as the government is providing vegetable seeds. \n- The project will promote Hand Washing Practices and a refresher trainings for volunteers on hand washing using the ECV Response\ntools is planned. BRCS will launch a community-wide campaign to raise awareness about the importance of hand washing in preventing\nthe spread of diseases\nand improving overall health in three districts.\n- Purchase and Distribute soaps to 800 registered households promote regular hand washing practices, especially before meals and after\nusing the toilet.\nThe WASH strategy will improve access to safe water as an immediate need and enhance general health prevention as risk mitigation to\navoid worsening food insecurity due to outbreaks and risk hygiene practices.\n3- Multipurpose cash to enhance the revenue capacity to access food and basic needs and potentially access other priority needs.\n550 Households will be supported with unconditional multipurpose cash grants to empower beneficiaries to prioritize their needs\naccording to their individual circumstances, promoting dignity, autonomy, and empowerment. BWP 750 will be provided per month for 3\nmonths. Totalizing BWP 2250. Families will prioritize on the immediate needs such as food, healthcare, education, or income-generating\nactivities based on their unique circumstances. The drought has led to food shortages and heightened food insecurity, particularly among\nvulnerable populations such as children, pregnant women, and the elderly. The value for cash is aligned with the Government standard\nfor cash interventions set-up under social services department. \nThe NS has a contract with the FSP which is Botswana Post and this contract is currently active, therefore, they will be used for this\noperation. the advantage of this is that Botswana post has an agreement with Choppies Supermarket, which would give the beneficiaries\noptions of essential item to priorities. its should also be mentioned that Choppie Supermarket is one of the the largest supermarket in\nBotswana with chain stores in all districts.\n4- Food security and livelihood will prioritize solutions that will boost the households income capacity during the current period to\naccess food and boost their capacity to access basic needs and services. It will also prioritize contribution to the local production by\nensuring the most common household subsistence farming activity is reinforce. \n- BRCS will support at least 100 households farmers with livestock feeding or feeding supplements for Farmers.  This will target\nhouseholds with livestock who are experiencing challenges. They will be receiving feeds as per the assessment report main gaps that was\nreleased by the government on 24 May 2024.\n- A Poultry farming (layers) intervention is proposed. BRCS will assist 120 households to diversify livelihoods among farmers and reduce\ndependency on rain-fed agriculture and adapt to the changing environmental conditions. The poultry support includes procurement of\n50 chicks, the farm structure, layer cage, 50 point of lay pullets, water system, feed, egg collection trays, medicine, transport and\ninstallation at the site. This is an immediate relief for families as households will benefit from nutritional value of eggs and profits from\negg sales. It also offers a reliable source of protein and income, contributing to food security and economic stability. By engaging in these\nactivities, the community gains valuable skills and resources that can support them during future droughts, reducing their dependence\non external aid and enhancing their medium term resilience.\n- Having seen the positive impact that climate smart agriculture and water conservation activities have had in improving the soil quality\nand agricultural outputs in Gweta, the NS intends to conduct similar trainings in Mabutsane, Hukuntsi and North-East Districts. This is an\nPage 12 / 22\neffort to educate the community farmers on sustainable farming practices that save water, are not harmful to the soil and will help\nmitigate impacts of future droughts and other climate change related risks. These trainings will target smallholder farmers, pastoralists,\ncommunity-based organizations, farmer cooperatives and village leadership to foster self-reliance, long term sustainability and adapt to\nthe current climatic challenges.\n5- Integrated community engagement to support sustainable and resilient community practices \nThe planned trainings for volunteers, will cover CEA and Feedback Response Mechanisms modules to ensure that there is clear\nprocedures for responding to community feedback promptly and transparently. Once assessments for beneficiaries\u2019 selection start, there\nwill be regular reporting by the project team on project progress, outcomes, and impact to maintain transparency and accountability to\nthe community.\nAn extensive strategy will be in place to engage the community leaders and maintain a two way feedback and communication all through\nthe intervention. The team will organize the information sessions to the communities to assist through their local representative and\ntrusted channels. In the targeting process, BRCS will be involving Community leaders and Influencers in decision-making processes to\nensure that community voices are heard. Harmonized solutions will always been prioritized and the details implementation plan will be\noriented based on community feedback and local consensus with key stakeholders for various areas of interventions. Botswana Red\nCross Society will also ensure Community Engagement and Accountability serve as a leverage for a sustainable change willing to initiate in\nthe local communities and active stakeholders. The NS, In the three Districts will conduct stakeholder\u2019s engagements to involve them and\nget their support for the various initiatives in this DREF and reflexion on long term or resilient solutions. There will be at least 6\nCommunity Meetings where members can provide feedback, ask questions, and voice concerns about the project. Ongoingly, there will\nbe Social Media Platforms, office telephone and emails available to engage with the community, gather feedback, and address concerns in\nreal-time.\n7- Path for transitional plan and long term solutions\n- Collaborative efforts involving government agencies, non-governmental organizations, community groups, and other stakeholders are\nessential to effectively address the complex challenges faced by farmers and communities affected by the drought. This will also\ncontribute to the project sustainability beyond the funding.\n- Continuous data collection to inform further operational design and exit strategy. The recent update report from Ministry of Local\nGovernment and Rural Development highlighted the urgent need to address the food insecurity and health challenges exacerbated by\ndrought conditions. As the Government of Botswana is expected to release a comprehensive report on Drought in Botswana in June/July\n2024, this forthcoming information will guide the National Society in determining the necessity of requesting additional funding to\neffectively address the scale of the identified issues.\n- Botswana Red Cross Society will also ensure Community Engagement and Accountability as a leverage to build sustainable change and\nadvocate for good and safe practices, smart and sustainable agricultural practices, climate considerations and disaster management etc.\nThere will be effort during this intervention to bring key community opinion leaders among the farmers, economical stakeholders, key\nactors in the context to exchange and engage on the sustainable initiatives that community can agreed on and contribute to increase the\nimpact of this DREF.\n- Community feedbacks collected all along the DREF operation will serve as a key parameter for the priority definition in a potential\nrevision. Same as the learnings and Post distribution data if already available.\n- BRCS current strategy is built to help on the seasonal transitional impact. The Poultry egg project is an exit strategy as post the support,\nhouseholds will have built resilience and continued livelihoods project.\n- NS has a plan to advocate for tree planting project beyond the DREF. Hence, the importance of the DRR and long term solutions will be\npart of the messages to the communities and local institutions/stakeholders. The NS will build on and strengthen existing local\ninstitutions such as Community Based Organizations and horticultural cooperatives by conducting the necessary consultation and\ninception meetings to give the community an opportunity to have an input in the implementation roll out.\n- BRCS will scale-up the communication and advocacy on the drought challenge and food insecurity activating various leadership and\noperational platforms. BRCS will also use various methods such as social media, radio, print media and television to reach a broader\naudience.\nTargeting Strategy\nWho will be targeted through this operation?\nThe Botswana Red Cross Society (BRCS) aims to assist the most vulnerable populations in Hukuntsi, Mabutse, and the North-East district\naffected by persistent drought-induced food insecurity. The primary objective is to support 1,070 households, benefiting approximately\n5,350 individuals, by addressing their basic needs within a 6-month operation.\nThe decision to focus on the Mabutsane, Hukuntsi, and North-East Districts for drought relief operations is based on the summary of the\ndrought and vulnerability situation report released by the Rural Development Secretariat under the Ministry of Local Government and\nRural Development on 24 May 2024. The Village Extension Team provides a suitable platform for selecting households. BRCS will\ncollaborate closely with local clinics and community health care nurses to provide support in screening nominated families. Based on this\ninput, BRCS will assess households for eligibility of the nominated families. BRCS will select targeted households among the food-insecure\nPage 13 / 22\ncommunities using the following criteria:\n-Children under 5 years diagnosed with malnutrition in the last 6 months.\n-Children under 5 years discharged from the Supplementary Feeding Programme but still at risk.\n-Lactating mothers with infants under 6 months showing early signs of malnutrition.\n-Household size may also be considered.\nThe selection criteria were carefully chosen to ensure that the most vulnerable populations are prioritized and that interventions are\ntailored to the unique needs of each community. Communities that have already received other forms of support will not be prioritized\nto prevent duplication of efforts.\nFor the nutrition activities, the selection will be coordinated with the Government. For farming and multipurpose cash (MPC) activities,\npriority will be given to households experiencing heightened vulnerabilities and those whose farming activities have been impacted by\nthe drought, especially the dry spell since late 2023. Households meeting the social vulnerabilities listed above will be prioritized, and\nfurther selection will consider economic vulnerabilities.\nEconomic vulnerabilities that will be considered for the 550 households targeted for the MPC include families with low or no income-\ngenerating activities, household ownership of dwellings, assets, and livestock, and the primary source of income being linked to climate\nperformance and the frequency of existing income activities.\nAdditional economic vulnerabilities to be considered for farming assistance include farmers whose households rely on farming as the\nmain or only subsistence activity, farmers whose livestock have died in the dry spells witnessed since February 2024, etc.\nExplain the selection criteria for the targeted population\nThe Botswana Red Cross Society (BRCS) will utilize community-based targeting strategies to identify individuals eligible for assistance,\nensuring active involvement of community members, local leaders, and stakeholders. Prior to initiating the targeting process,\ncomprehensive selection criteria will be discussed and collectively endorsed by community members to ensure transparency and mutual\nagreement.\nThis participatory approach empowers communities to rank households based on their susceptibility to food insecurity, ensuring that aid\nis directed to those most in need. By fostering transparency and community ownership, this inclusive methodology enables precise\nbeneficiary identification tailored to the unique circumstances and requirements of each locality.\nTo ensure continuous community involvement, the National Society (NS) will hold regular community engagements throughout the\nimplementation of this operation. These sessions will provide a platform for community members to voice their concerns, offer feedback,\nand participate actively in decision-making processes.\nIn addition to these strategies, the NS will collaborate with local leaders and stakeholders to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the\ntargeting process. This collaboration aims to adapt and refine the approach as necessary, ensuring that interventions remain relevant and\neffective in addressing the specific needs of the communities.\nThrough this comprehensive and inclusive approach, the Botswana Red Cross Society aims to build stronger, more resilient communities\ncapable of responding to and recovering from the impacts of food insecurity and other related challenges.\nAge Distribution:\nBotswana has a youthful population, with a higher percentage in younger age groups compared to older age groups. The age group 0-4\nyears has the highest share of the population, followed by subsequent age groups, with the age group of 100 years and above having the\nlowest share. The age distribution, particularly the presence of vulnerable groups such as children and the elderly in rural and remote\nareas, was considered in the selection process. These demographic segments are more susceptible to the adverse effects of drought,\nincluding food insecurity, malnutrition, and health-related issues.\nGender Dynamics:\nGender dynamics play a crucial role in determining vulnerability to drought. Women and girls often bear the brunt of drought impacts,\nas they are primarily responsible for household water and food security. By targeting districts with a significant female population, the\naim is to address gender disparities in access to relief assistance and promote gender-sensitive interventions.\nSocio-Economic Activities:\nLivelihood Dependence:\nThe livelihoods of communities in the Hukuntsi, Mabutsane, and North-East Districts are predominantly based on agriculture, livestock\nfarming, and traditional pastoralism. These socio-economic activities are highly susceptible to fluctuations in rainfall and are therefore\nseverely impacted by drought conditions. By targeting districts where agriculture and livestock rearing are central to livelihoods, the aim\nis to address the immediate needs of vulnerable households facing food and income insecurity.\nIncome Levels:\nSocio-economic indicators such as household income levels and access to employment opportunities were considered in the selection\nPage 14 / 22\nprocess. Communities with lower income levels and limited employment opportunities, especially women and youth, are more likely to\nexperience heightened vulnerability during drought periods, as they may lack the financial resources to cope with the impacts of crop\nfailure and livestock losses.\nLandscape Vulnerabilities:\nEnvironmental Degradation:\nThe Hukuntsi, Mabutsane, and North-East Districts are characterized by semi-arid landscapes with fragile ecosystems that are particularly\nsusceptible to environmental degradation and desertification. Drought exacerbates these vulnerabilities, leading to land degradation, loss\nof biodiversity, and reduced ecosystem services. By targeting districts with vulnerable landscapes, the aim is to mitigate the\nenvironmental impacts of drought and promote sustainable land management practices.\nWater Scarcity:\nAccess to water is a critical issue in arid and semi-arid regions like the Kgalagadi and Central Districts. These areas often face chronic\nwater scarcity, which is exacerbated during drought periods. By focusing on districts where water scarcity is a pressing concern, the aim\nis to prioritize interventions that address immediate water needs, such as the rehabilitation of water sources and the provision of water-\nsaving technologies.\nWithin these three districts, BRCS will collaborate closely with the Social and Community Development (S&CD) Offices and Health Centres\nto select specific villages and communities (households) eligible for either cash transfers or food packages. This response will employ the\neligibility criteria used by the S&CDs for various social protection systems provided by the government, including the Vulnerable Group\nFeeding programme, the Orphan Care programme, and the Destitute Persons programme.\nTotal Targeted Population\nWomen\n2,100\nRural\n100%\nGirls (under 18)\n1,230\nUrban\n0%\nMen\n1,200\nPeople with disabilities (estimated)\n10%\nBoys (under 18)\n820\nTotal targeted population\n5,350\nRisk and Security Considerations\nPlease indicate about potential operation risk for this operations and mitigation actions\nRisk\nMitigation action\nBeneficiary security.\nCommunities will be informed of the operation through CEA\nengagement.

Briefly\ndescribe their role.\n36 volunteers will be enlisted for Community Volunteer Assistant (CVA) interventions, distributions, and project monitoring. They will be\ndeployed to assist in conducting household assessments, registration and verification of beneficiaries, post-distribution monitoring,\nsurveys, and key messaging dissemination workshops. All volunteers will undergo training in Community Engagement and Accountability\nPage 19 / 22\n(CEA), Participatory Geographic Information (PGI), livelihoods, and water management. Additionally, all volunteers have actively\nparticipated in community health activities.\nA total of 6 Botswana Red Cross Society (BRCS) staff members will lead this initiative throughout the operation. Four staff members are\nfrom the BRCS headquarters, while two staff members are based in the districts where the operation will take place. These field-based\nstaff members possess extensive knowledge of the area, its inhabitants, and their needs. BRCS will ensure that 4 HQ staff members are\nfully dedicated to the implementation, monitoring, and reporting of the intervention. This team includes the Disaster Management\nCoordinator, Finance Officer, and 2 Drivers. Given their essential roles, they are indispensable throughout the operation. Therefore,\nrecognizing the National Society's staffing constraints, support for their salaries is included in the planning and implementation of this\ninitiative.\nIf there is procurement, will it be done by National Society or IFRC?\nNational Society will conduct the procurements at National level following the established standards and existing National law and\nGovernment standards established. The cash support will be provided through mobile money and NS has already a valid contract with an\nFSP.\nHow will this operation be monitored?\nThe Botswana Red Cross Society (BRCS) has an operational Planning, Monitoring, Evaluation, and Reporting (PMER) unit responsible for\noverseeing and reporting on its operations. The Disaster Management (DM) unit ensures the effective implementation of projects while\nmaintaining accountability to stakeholders and donors. This is achieved through robust project planning, monitoring, evaluation, and\nreporting processes.\nA monitoring framework with specific timeframes will be developed with support from the IFRC. This tool will provide technical support,\ntrack implementation progress, identify challenges, and manage risks that could delay timely implementation, allowing for remedial\nactions throughout the project phase. Additionally, IFRC will conduct monitoring visits to provide the NS with technical assistance.\nPlease briefly explain the National Societies communication strategy for this\noperation\nThe National Society (NS), in collaboration with the IFRC communication focal point, will meticulously document all operations and\ndisseminate updates across various social media platforms. This initiative aims to ensure broad visibility and provide up-to-date\ninformation to the public and stakeholders. Furthermore, the team will gather and spotlight success stories, demonstrating the positive\neffects of the interventions and the resilience of the supported communities. Through these narratives, the NS seeks to raise awareness,\npromote transparency, and encourage additional support for its endeavors.\nPage 20 / 22\nBudget Overview\nClick here to download the budget file\nPage 21 / 22\nContact Information\nFor further information, specifically related to this operation please contact:\nNational Society contact:\nTshepo Dixon, Program Manager, tshepog@botswanaredcross.org, +26774034213\nIFRC Appeal Manager:\nKopano Masilo, Head of the Delegation, kopano.masilo@ifrc.org, 0663203886\nIFRC Project Manager:\nBongeka Mpinke, Senior Disaster Management Officer, bongeka.mpinke@ifrc.org, 0747920279\nIFRC focal point for the emergency:\nBongeka Mpinke, Senior Disaster Management Officer, bongeka.mpinke@ifrc.org, 0747920279\nMedia Contact:\nSusan Nzisa Mbalu, Communication Manager, susan.mbalu@ifrc.org, +254733827654\nClick here for the reference\nPage 22 / 22\n"

On 4th March, the Government through the Office of the vice president and Disaster Management Mitigation Unit (DMMU) called\nfor consultative meeting with all relevant stakeholders to lobby for support following the declaration of the emergency. The Government\nindicated that there is need for multisectoral collaboration in responding to the emergency that has affected 1 million families across\nZambia.\nThe whole Southern half of Zambia is experiencing a drought. The provinces affected include North-Western, Southern, Western, Central\nand Eastern. The country started experiencing the dry spells from 20th January when the rains were expected to be at a peak and crops\nto establish.\nThe drought currently experienced has affected a total of 8 provinces across the country with highest impacts in Southern, Central,\nEastern, North-western, Western, and Lusaka Provinces. 1 million households have been affected, and the situation has resulted in\ndevastating impacts, with about 1 million hectors of maize field affected out of 2.2 million hectors planted in 2023/2024 season.\u00a0\u00a0\nCrops especially maize, legumes, grounds nuts, millet, soghum and others are withering due to insufficient moisture content. Water\npoints are drying up making it difficult for people to access safe and clean water for domestic consumption. Pasture is drying up making\nis difficult for livestock. Price for food items and other basic commodities has continued to rise due to high demand as most community\nmembers have to depend on the markets.\u00a0\nCrisis Category Supporting Document\nPage 3 / 21\nThe most affected directly are small scale farmers who depend on rainfed cropping, livestock keepers and all community members who\ndepend on natural water bodies and shallow wells for water.\u00a0\nThe situation has come at the time when the government shared the Integrated Food Insecurity Phase Classification (IPC) report indicating\nthat in the period October 2023 and March 2024 an average of 2.04 million people are facing food insecurity.\nMaize field in Monze District\nAffected maize field in Mazabuka District\nStaff of ZRCS checking a drought affected\nfield\nScope and Scale\nThe current drought has affected 8 provinces across the country, with highest impacts in Southern, Central, Eastern, North-western,\nWestern, and Lusaka Provinces out of the affected provinces. One (1) million households (five (5) million people) have been affected, and\nthe situation has resulted in devastating impacts, with about 1 million hectors of maize field withered out of 2.2 million hectors planted in\n2023/2024 season.\nAmong the most affected districts, Kalabo, Senanga, Sikongo, Shangombo and Sioma of Western province and Zambezi district in North-\nWestern have been hardly hit with a total population of 546,139. These districts are affected by drought and are in IPC phase 4 as\nhighlighted in the above. Lunga, Milengi, Rufunsa, Lupososhi and Mwansabombwe districts with a total population of 247,390 are not\naffected by the drought but are classified in IPC phase 4. There is a high probability that many districts experiencing drought and in IPC\nphase 3 and 4 could have graduated to the subsequent IPC phase, that is 4 and 5 respectively.  \nPredictions according to the Zambia Meteorological Department (ZMD) 7 days weather bulletin covering the period 2nd March 2024\nindicates that there is a 20% probability of recording rainfall exceeding 50mm in the southern half of the country while the northern half\nhas a 50% probability of receiving rainfall exceeding 50mm during the focused period. This entails that the situation in the southern half\nof the country is likely to continue deteriorating. It is believed that the Northern part of Zambia is accountable for 40% of the total food\nproduction of the country, while 60% is from the rest of the provinces that are severely hit by the drought. This entails that the 2023/34\nfood production will come from the Northern part of the country and will not be sufficient to meet the demand from drought affected\nprovinces.  \nCoping capacities from farmers are low due to over dependence on rain fed cropping. It is expected that the number of people facing\nhigh food insecurity and needing humanitarian assistance will continue rising in the coming months. The Government in collaboration\nwith stakeholders are carrying out rapid assessment to ascertain the levels of the impact and finalise its response plan. A  Zambia\nVulnerability Capacity Assessment (ZVAC) is planned for March to April this year for better planning of the response and long-term\ninterventions and prevent serious impacts in the next farming season.\nSource Information\nSource Name\nSource Link\nPage 4 / 21\n1. 2023/42 IPC report\n2.

Drought declaration by the president\nPrevious Operations\nHas a similar event affected the same area(s) in the last 3 years?\nYes\nDid it affect the same population group?\nYes\nDid the National Society respond?\nYes\nDid the National Society request funding form DREF for that\nevent(s)\nYes\nIf yes, please specify which operation\nMDRZM012- 2019 to 2021 and MDRZM014, 2022\nIf you have answered yes to all questions above, justify why the use of DREF for a recurrent event, or how this event should not be\nconsidered recurrent:\nZambia has continued to experience extreme weather events such as floods and drought due to the adverse impacts of climate\nchange and climate variability. During the 2018/ 2019 farming season, Zambia experienced low rainfall and prolonged dry spells in\nmost parts of the country that negatively affected the agriculture sector, especially crop and livestock production. The government,\nthrough IPC, assessed the impact on society and the economy and the required actions for rehabilitation, recovery and mitigate these\nimpacts. The devastating effects of prolonged dry spells coupled with late onset of the rainy season on agriculture production\nresulted in reduced food availability and access as well as depletion of seed stocks, contributing to the acute food insecurity\nconditions experienced across the country. Furthermore, the prolonged dry spells between January and March 2019 affected districts\nin Southern, Western and parts of Lusaka, Eastern and Central provinces. The food security situation led the National Society to\naccess funds for response through Emergency Appeal that run from 2019 to 2021 in only one District called Kalabo  of Western\nProvince.\nAccording to the IPC analysis 2021, from October 2021 to March 2022 which coincided with the lean season that led to the\ndeteriorated food security situation, with around 1.58 million people (13% of the analyzed population) classified in Crisis (IPC Phase 3\nand above). The most affected provinces were Luapula, Lusaka, North-Western, Northern, Southern and Western. As such, the NS\nrequested for a DREF for the food insecure population which supported in reducing food gaps, protected and restored livelihoods\nand the same Kalabo District was supported.\nIn the recent past, in addition to impacts of climate related emergencies, the country has experienced other events such as Anthrax,\nCholera, COVID-19, Army Worms and high prices for basic commodities coupled with high poverty levels. This has contributed to an\nincrease in vulnerability and exposure, especially for the lower income households. The current drought is part of the manifestation\nof the challenges that the country has been facing as the current situation is worse than previous droughts as it has affected the\nwhole Southern half of the country resulting in huge gap in humanitarian needs. The drought is more or less recurrent and the\ncountry has been able to meet the needs but now in 2024 it has been unable due to consecutive not so good seasons. The Republican\npresident of Zambia has declared this emergency looking at other scope, scale and other compounding factors that are likely to\nexacerbate the current situation hence the need for ZRCS to mobilize resources and support the call. The country is at the same time\nstruggling with Cholera outbreak as well as Anthrax whereby lack food and safe water due to drought are likely to worsen the\nsituation.\nZRCS is currently in the process of submitting forecast-based financing (FbF) Early Action Protocol (EAP) for Droughts which is under\nreview by IFRC. Some readiness activities for drought have been conducted in selected districts including Sinazongwe.\nhttps://www.ipcinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/ipc\ninfo/docs/IPC_Zambia_Acute_Food_Insecurity_Aug2\n023_Mar2024_Report.pdf\nhttps://www.parliament.gov.zm/sites/default/files/i\nmages/publication_docs/MINISTERIAL%20STATEME\nNT%20BY%20ENG.%20NZOVU.pdf\nhttps://www.cen.gov.zm/?\np=2078#:~:text=President%20Hichilema%20Declar\nes%20Drought%20National%20Disaster%20March\n%201,the%20government%20will%20undertake%2\n0to%20ameliorate%20the%20impact\nPage 5 / 21\nLessons learned:\nThe following are some of the key lessons learnt from the past responses:\n-\nThere was full engagement of stakeholders from the program's initial stages up to the end, which helped everyone understand\nthe program and showed transparency. This will be replicated in the current to improve coordination and engagement.\n-\nNeeds and market assessments are key in informing response options and strategy as they help to focus on appropriate\ninterventions in the community.\n-\nTrained Volunteers and National Disaster Response Teams (NDRTs) played a crucial role in the implementation of the\ninterventions. \n-\nParticipatory Beneficiary targeting, selection, registration and validation is key to enhance ownership, participation and\nsustainability of the response.\n-\nIt was learnt that community sensitization messages at the onset of any Project should be concise and clear on the source and\nproper use of funds. The NS use and engage the community through community meeting at the beginning of the project\nimplementation.\n-\nDevelopment of exist and sustainability plans at the beginning of the operation is key.\n- Cash transfer modality has been very effective tool to reaching out to the affected population as in all the previous operations, the\nmarkets were fully functional \n-\nIn an emergency appeal implementation, the activities for capital investment should be implemented at the beginning of the\noperation for proper and timely monitoring before the end of the operation. The drought appeal in Kalabo District from 2019 to 2021\nhad some capital investment on solar powered boreholes where communities are able to do some irrigation activities. This was done\ntowards the end of the operation with limited time to monitor the functionality of the system.\n-\nTimely early warning messages through anticipatory action help farmers to plant drought tolerant seed variety in times of\ndrought.\nCurrent National Society Actions\nStart date of National Society actions\n2023-12-11\nLivelihoods And Basic Needs\nFollowing the IPC 2023 report, the NS, through support from the ECHO PPP project, has\nresponded to 2,000 food insecure households in Sioma District of Western province\nunder IPC 4 with multipurpose food distribution.\nWater, Sanitation And Hygiene\nWith the El-nino preparedness efforts by NS and support from NLRC, the NS donated\n10,000 of 750mm of liquid chlorine to Ministry of Health for distribution in Cholera hot\nspot communities for household water treatment. The districts supported in Southern\nProvince include Sinazongwe, Siavonga and Gwembe.\nCoordination\nAfter the Presidential declaration on drought in the country, the Government of Zambia\nthrough the Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit has activated all the relevant\nclusters at National level such as Food security, Agriculture and livestock, Nutrition,\nWASH, RCCE, Education, Early recovery, Energy, Logistics and Protection. The NS is a\nmember of other clusters including the National Cash Working group, WASH and\nprotection cluster and Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE)\ncoordination working Groups.  The clusters are currently planning for rapid assessments\nand development of Response and Recovery plan of which ZRCS is participating. \nDisaster National Consultative Forum meeting was called for by DMMU and chaired by\nthe Secretary to the Cabinet and NS/IFRC participated in this forum where plans for\nDrought response were discussed.\nCurrently, the NS responds to Anthrax and Cholera outbreaks through DREF and\nCholera Emergency Appeal. The NS/IFRC will ensure coordination between all the\nDREF/Appeal funded operations through Incident Management Systems (IMS) and the\nnewly established static Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) established by the Cholera\nAppeal. All the key NS Departments and partners (NLRC and IFRC) will continue holding\njoint meetings to plan, review and strategize on the ongoing response operations.\nZRCS is a member of different DRM structures at different levels, that is provincial\nPage 6 / 21\nDisaster Management Committees (PDMC) at provincial level, District Disaster\nManagement Committee (DDMC) at District level and Satellite Disaster Management\nCommittee (SDMC) and Welfare Assistance Committee (CWAC) at community level. These\nwill form the basis for better coordination of the response efforts.\nNational Society Readiness\nThe NS developed an El-nino Preparedness and Response plan that has been guiding the\nearly actions in some Districts.\nWith support from Netherlands RC, the NS from December 2023 has been conducting\nearly actions for El-nino preparedness in Sinazongwe, Gwembe, Siavonga and Chirundu\ndistricts of Southern Province to minimize the anticipated impacts. The focus of early\nactions was centered around Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) through provision of key\nearly warning messages targeting WASH, Food security, Zoonotic Diseases and PGI/CEA in\nthe high-risk communities.\nThe NS has 50 trained National Disaster Response Team members ready for deployment\nfor support in the response efforts. Some NDRTs are already deployed in support of the\nCholera and Anthrax response. The same NDRTs can support the Drought response\nefforts where Districts overlap.\nThe National Society is planning to distribute NFIs procured and prepositioned under\nECHO PPP and Response Preparedness III project. The items include soap, water\njerricans and Chlorine.\nThe NS has an agreement with MTN as a CVA mobile money financial service provider\nand has prequalified suppliers for emergency procurements and updated their\nprocurement manual to accommodate them to avoid delays.\nThe NS has a branch in the Sinazongwe District for the Drought response. ZRCS has a\ntotal of 495(male 294 females 201) volunteers in the targeted district. Additionally, the\nprovince (s) has a total of 7(6 males and 1 female) NDRTs who be deployed to support the\nimplementation of the proposed response operations.\nAssessment\nThe government has organized a joint rapid assessment in affected districts through the\nactivated clusters, with the ZRCS participating.\nActivation Of Contingency Plans\nThe NS has activated its multi-hazard Contingency Plan (MHCP) of which drought is one\nof the hazards of focus. The threshold of triggering the MHPC for drought is supposed\nto be 1,000 households and above that are affected and require immediate assistance. In\nthis case, the NS requires to mobilize resources and activate the plan. According to the\npresidential declaration for drought, 1 million households are affected and need urgent\nassistance. Therefore, the NS has activated its MHCP and the Incident Management\nSystem (IMS) to facilitate e\ufb00ective and e\ufb03cient response.\nNational Society EOC\nThe NS has activated the static EOC at its Headquarters through the Cholera response\nwhich will also incorporate the drought response.\nIFRC Network Actions Related To The Current Event\nSecretariat\nThe IFRC has 2 country Delegates (Operations Delegates and 1 under CSP program)\nworking closely with the national Society in providing guidance and development of the\noperation plans. Currently, the IFRC has technical surge supporting the Cholera\nresponse, such as WASH, RCCE/CEA, Public Health in Emergencies, PMER Communication\nand Information management. As part of the ongoing support to NS, the in-country\ndelegate supports the overall technical and strategic management of the operations.\nIFRC continues to support the ZRCS in putting up systems and tools for emergency\npreparedness and response in collaboration with NLRC and other external partners such\nPage 7 / 21\ntools include follow up on Preparedness for Effective Response processes as well as\ndevelopment of Early Action Protocols and its activation.\nParticipating National Societies\nThe Netherlands Red Cross (NLRC) is the only PNS in country and has been supporting\nthe ZRCS in several response operations, including bilateral support to the previous\ndrought response operations as well as the Cholera Emergency response in 2024. Over\nthe   years, the NLRC has supported the National Society in its emergency preparedness\nand response efforts through its Response and Preparedness project. Currently the\nNLRC through ECHO PPP is supporting the cash transfer program in Sioma District\nICRC Actions Related To The Current Event\nCurrently there is no in- country ICRC delegation in Zambia.\nOther Actors Actions Related To The Current Event\nGovernment has requested international\nassistance\nNo\nNational authorities\nThe President Mr. Hakainde Hichilema on Thursday 29th February 2024 declared the\ncountry to be experiencing drought of which 84 Districts have been triggered. The\ngovernment through the DMMU has activated the cluster.\nOn 4th March the Government called for stakeholder consultative meeting to discuss the\ndeclaration of the emergency and lobby for support from all stakeholders.\nDissemination of alerts and early warning messages on EL NINO weather conditions in all\nthe a\ufb00ected areas as per the forecasted information on the rainfall pattern by the\nmeteorological Department.\nThrough an insurance programme, the DMMU has been supporting farmers in the El-\nNino affected Districts with seeds to replant *in case of crop failure.\nThe Government through the activated clusters is developing a comprehensive Response\nand recovery plan for resource mobilization of the response. Rapid assessment is\nunderway to ascertain the magnitude of the problem across the country.\nUN or other actors\nOther partners and UN agencies are part of the clusters activated and a 5W matrix is\nbeing developed for partners to indicated what and where they will be supporting in\nthis response.\nWFP and Food Agriculture and Livestock together with Red Cross are members of the\nFood security agriculture and livestock cluster.\nAre there major coordination mechanism in place?\nThe Government through the DMMU has activated the clusters related to the drought response such as Health, Food Security and\nAgriculture, WASH, Energy, logistics, protection and Early recovery. A consultative meeting was organized to agree on the way forward\nwhere the Government indicated the clusters have started their meeting to plan for the response.\nZRCS is part of the Food security, WASH, Health. Early recovery and protection clusters\nInternally, the NA has also activated the Incident Management system where all partners are meeting to discuss the response in\ncollaboration with the Cholera response team. At District level, the branch and project staff will also be taking part in all coordination\nforums.\nPage 8 / 21\nNeeds (Gaps) Identified\nLivelihoods And Basic Needs\nThe country faces the worst kind of drought exacerbated by El Nino weather conditions in the 2023/2024 rain season influenced by\ncClimate change. The situation has come at a time when 2.04 million people across the country are already facing food insecurity revealed\nby IPC Report 2023. Some of the drivers to food insecurity includes pPoor agricultural practices in the face of climate change, floods, high\nfood prices, fall army worms and cassava brown streak disease. The drought has not just affected the availability of food for humans, but\nlivestock and called for immediate support. The probability of having increased food prices and scarcity of food commodities in the\nmarket is very high as the whole southern half of Zambia has been affected which accounts for 60% of the total food production of the\ncountry. The scarcity of food in the country may also contribute to exacerbation of other problems such as Cholera and Anthrax which\nhave been some of epidemics the country is struggling with. In the absence of food, people tend to compromise hygiene practices and\nhence increase in Cholera cases. At the same time, access to game meat and other livestock would be an option to cover up the food\nshortages hence further spread of Anthrax.\nChange and variability are important contributors to the high poverty incidence in rural Zambia which is estimated at 76.6% Reliance on\nrainfed agriculture drives the high prevalence of poverty in rural Zambia, and among smallholder farmers. Zambia has witnessed an\nincrease in the incidence of climate shocks such as droughts, seasonal and flash floods, extreme temperatures, and dry spells. These\nweather extremes have significant knock-on side effects on rural farmers who depend on rain-fed agriculture for their livelihoods.\nThere is a need to consider the affected households with basic commodities that will protect and restore their livelihoods.\n- Currently, Zambia is in the rains season which covers from October to April. However, the dry spell started very early and the level of\nmoisturize is low or limited to few areas. \n- The dry season in Zambia normally come around September to November with few rains from October to November. \nIn general, the Agricultural calendar follows the below calendar:\n- Winter cropping is from May - August\n- Lean season November - March and this is because there is normally no harvesting. \nThe dry spell witness since January in Zambia has led to the failure of the cropping season for most of the communities. This will have an\nimpact in the coming harvest season while the already IPC3+ communities are dealing with the lean period characterized by no\nharvesting.\nHealth\nThe health implications of the current drought are numerous and far reaching. Some drought-related health effects are \nexperienced\nin the short-term and can be directly observed and measured. However, the slow rise or chronic nature of drought can result in longer\nterm, indirect health implications that are not always easy to anticipate or monitor. Some expected impacts are compromised food and\nnutrition that may include increased malnutrition in affected communities and increased incidence of illness and disease due to poor\neating habits and hygiene practices. \nAnalysis by age groups shows that stunting is highest (46 percent) in children 18\u201323 months and lowest (19 percent) in children under six\nmonths. Children in rural areas (36 percent) are more likely to be stunted than those in urban areas (32 percent). At the provincial level,\nNorthern has the highest percentage of stunted children (46 percent), followed by Luapula (45 percent). Levels of stunting are lowest in\nWestern and Southern provinces (29 percent each).\nThe current food insecurity might worsen the situation in all the affected Districts, hence need for interventions to address the gaps.\nWater, Sanitation And Hygiene\nThe dry spell that has affected the country has resulted in the water table lowering resulting in water stress and boreholes drying up as\nwe approach the next rainy season. The surface and ground water have been affected, including rivers, shallow wells, streams and\nboreholes, leading to insufficient clean and safe water for domestic, livestock and agriculture use. Currently there are issues around\nwater contamination, hence the cholera outbreak and other waterborne diseases. There is likelihood of conflict over water use and the\ncompeting needs for human and agricultural and livestock consumption and some transboundary issues will have to be managed. There\nare reports that the Kariba dam levels will continue to reduce, and this will affect the electricity generation for both Zimbabwe and\nPage 9 / 21\nZambia. Farmers may lose their animals, which affects their livelihood and social well-being. The communities will need to be supported\nwith improved water supply sources, WASH non-\nfood commodities, hygiene promotion and household water treatment. It is important to note that during drought, both surface and\nunderground water sources are affected, hence the importance of establishing resilient water networks remains a challenge and can only\nbe addressed thorough medium to long term actions. It would then be vital that the assessments done in the selected provinces be used\nto support lobbying for fundraising campaigns and be incorporated in the current One WASH plans.\nProtection, Gender And Inclusion\nThe impact of disaster affects the social groups differently. Increased economic hardships due to drought that can lead to food insecurity\nfor example has the potential to affect these sub-groups (women and children, People with Disabilities-PWD) through social exclusion and\nmarginalization, Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) and Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (SEA) including child labor. Scarcity in\nresources during emergencies creates tensions and heightens the risks of sexual and gender-based violence mostly for girls and women.\nThe underlying causes of violence are associated with attitudes, beliefs, norms and structures that promote and/or condone gender-\nbased discrimination and unequal power dynamics. In the face of drought and loss of livelihoods, those entrusted to protect girls and\nyoung women can be the ones that endanger their lives and wellbeing. As a way of coping with the economic pressure, women and girls\nare most likely to engage into negative coping mechanism such as prostitution to make ends meet which can lead to the spread of HIV.\nThere is also a high probability of men migrating to other areas in search of food and leave their families vulnerable.\nPGI will be incorporated in this response to ensure protection and inclusion of different groups of marginalized people in decision\nmaking and overall response interventions.\nCommunity Engagement And Accountability\nConsideration of Risk Community Communication and Engagement (RCCE) is vital in an emergency response. The current drought\nsituation requires community engagement in ensuring people have enough knowledge on all the key pillars, that is Food security, WASH,\nHealth and PGI. Community engagement is needed for information and programme implementation as well as the establishment of\ngenuine two-way communication or community feedback systems to make the operation effective. The drought response will ensure the\nfacilitation of community engagement, understand the communities, and translate risk into locally appropriate ways of addressing the\nneeds as per the pillars of the operation. The RCCE and CEA will focus on the following key aspects in each pillar of the response:\n-\nFor Food insecurity - proper management in terms of conservation and preservation of the little food stocks available to the affected\nhouseholds to avoid wastage and prevent malnutrition. \n-\nFor WASH- RCCE on proper use of available water sources to avoid a situation of not having any water sources within reach which\nmay result into serious water borne disease outbreak or increase the spread of the Cholera outbreak already in most Districts as well as\ngenerating community conflicts.\nAny identified gaps/limitations in the assessment\nCurrently there is no assessments done apart from the IPC report that was based on Zambia Vulnerability Assessment. A joint rapid\nassessment has been planned that will help in adjusting the plans to address the actual gaps in the response. The Government is also\nplanning to do a ZVAC earlier that the normal period to ascertain the levels of the impact and determine the way forward on the\nresponse. It is anticipated that serious impact of the drought will be felt around June moving forward.\nOperational Strategy\nOverall objective of the operation\nThis DREF aims at supporting 32,000 households (160,000people) a\ufb00ected by drought in Gwembe and Sinazongwe districts of Southern\nprovince provinces by providing support around Food Security and livelihoods, Health and WASH. Additionally, the strategy will integrate\ncommunity engagement and accountability/RCCE, as well as protection Gender and inclusion across all sectors, for the overall operational\ntimeframe of 6 months. In six months' time, a lessons learnt workshop is planned to review the operation lessons in collaboration with\nthe ZCAC results update the operation as per the newly identified gaps in support especially on resilience building and sustainable\ninterventions to avoid serious recurrence of the problem.\nZRCS will conduct a detailed assessment to identify the actual needs, gaps of the affected population and mapping of key actors per\nPage 10 / 21\nintervention pillar. The assessment will also capture information on the needs and priorities of different community groups, preferred\ncommunication channels for receiving information and giving feedback, community social and power dynamics. \nAn overall 86 districts across the country are currently affected but due to limited financial resources, the ZRCS will, through this\noperation, focus its response on complementing actions already provided by Zambian Government and its partners through supporting\none district.\nOperation strategy rationale\nThe NS with support from NLRC, conducted some early actions in selected Districts, Sinazongwe, Chirundu, Siyavonga and Gwembe\nDistricts of Southern Province. The actions aimed at minimising the impacts of drought worsen by the the anticipated Elnino. The focus\nareas were Food Insecurity, WASH and Animal Disease prevention (Zoonotic disease), Protection Gender and Inclusion (PGI) and\nCommunity Engagement and Accountability (CEA).\nFollowing the declaration of the Drought emergency, ZRCS is aiming at addressing the immediate needs of the targeted group through\nthis DREF request which will be followed by a detailed assessment to ascertain the gaps in the affected District. An operation update will\nbe produced to adjust the DREF intervention that will aim at supporting the early recovery efforts. After a period of six months, another\noperations update will be produced following the Zambia Vulnerability Capacity Assessment report(ZVAC) and the Integrated Food\nInsecurity phase classification (IPC)report as well as lessons learnt to adjust the interventions for longer term solutions in the targeted\ndistricts. \nThis slow onset DREF strategy will be to respond to the situation by providing Immediate and short-term support as well as earl and long-\nterm recovery across the identified key sectors of priority at each phase. Since this is a slow onset disaster, a detailed assessment will be\ndone to identify gaps and needs and update the operation to integrate the identified gaps backed by evidence. The operations update will\nfollow as per detailed below to define the next activities phase in accordance with the ongoing weather and agricultural calendar or early\nrecovery phasis. The NS will also consider the Government response plan under development in building the adequate and coordinated\nactions for the next phasis. This make the current plan revisable as follow: \n- A first update to be done following the assessment by April. \n- A 6 month operational update  by September to inform on progress and adjust/refine the transition/exit strategy depending on the\nproposed next phase intervention and adequate early recovery actions that are coordinated with Government response plan and active\npartners. This will also define the clear approach and actions for long term planning.\nThe following are the strategies to be used per pillar:\nFood security and Livelihoods:\n- Emergency cash support to IPC3+ \nTo address the immediate food needs, ZRCS will conduct a market assessment to ascertain the functionality of the markets for\nmultipurpose cash transfer support to vulnerable households in the affected Districts. If the markets are functional and food is available,\nthe targeted households will be provided with cash for food through mobile money transfer. ZRCS has a valid FSP agreement with the\nmobile service provider, MTN. If markets aren\u2019t functional, ZRCS will consider other options such as procurement and distribution of\nrelief food (in-kind support). ZRCS will support with training in Climate Agriculture and provision of drought tolerant seeds and other\nfarm inputs to selected vulnerable households to sustain their livelihoods through winter cropping where there are enough water\nsources. \n- Support of food production:\nTo sustain the general availability of food in the community, the cash distribution will be complemented with intrant provision to small\nfarmers. This actions will aim to strengthen the food production with benefit of the rains were it still witnessed in some locations. This\nactivity will learn from the climate effect on the crops witnessed in the communities currently. As such, the approach will be to provide\nboth adapted seed drought resistant even if targeting the areas were there still moisture in dumbbell areas. The detailed assessment will\ninclude the identification of the areas and the right culture and seeds that match the context of the communities and reality of climate\n(level of moisturize and weather projections).\n- Ensure training and continuous engagement of communities on key climate-smart agricultural practices (longer-implementation\nduration).\nThis intervention can only be sustainable and impactful with adequate ownership on the Climate smart agriculture and relevant\ncropping/harvesting technique. Hence, the plan is to ensure the training is provided to the farmers targeted and continuous monitoring\nfrom the distribution to the harvesting to see the impact of the assistance and build learnings for the next phasis. \n- Next phasis of the livelihood, the NS will be looking into similar support to farmers for the next winter/rainy cropping season. The\ndetailed assessment results, next IPC and priority of Government response plan will guide on the continuity of this support. \nZRCS intervention will give some impulsion to the market system. The various procurement of seeds, intrant and WASH made by the\noperation or the families assisted by cash will involve directly the local network of sellers and other actors of the food and agricultural\nstructure. ZRCS will prioritize the local markets and ensure engaging those actors to take part of these actions and beneficiaries to use the\nlocal market.  This will impulse the drivers of the economic activity in the market.\nPage 11 / 21\nWASH:\nConsidering the drought that has been experienced, most water sources are drying up and accessibility to both safe and unsafe water\nsources is expected to deteriorate in most of the affected Districts. The NS in the immediate and short term will support the affected\nhouseholds with WASH items such as Chlorine for household water treatment, water storage containers and soap for hygiene promotion.\nFor short-term support, chlorination at the point of collection source will be provided by trained volunteers. Volunteers will be trained\nand support door-to-door activities and use the PA system for hygiene promotion activities. ZRCS will ensure collaboration and\ncoordination of interventions under Cholera Emergency Appeal. \nBroken boreholes in targeted district will be rehabilitated. including training in water management committees and link them with local\nauthorities for institutional support. \nNS will cover the hygiene promotions tackling the essential escalating factors of food insecurity such as diseases, poor food management\nand nutrition behaviors, water management etc. Volunteers deployed in the field will cover the hygiene promotion and the messages\nthrough radio and the use of IEC material. The objective is to reach a minimum 160,000 people with messages that will prevent a\ndeterioration of the food insecurity induced by drought in the communities due to diseases, lack of adequate WASH facilities/practices\netc. The engagement of local leaders, representative will contribute to the communication strategy around the incidence of poor hygiene\nand health on the food insecurity escalation. \nHealth and Nutrition:\nThe current drought situation is expected to have health impacts due to inadequate food availability, accessibility, stability and utilization\nin most households that will result in poor nutrition status especially to the vulnerable groups such as pregnant women, under-five\nchildren and the chronically ill. \nThis response will also focus on working with Ministry of Health at all levels to identify the key health impacts and support with social\nmobilization efforts through training volunteers in CBHFA focusing on Nutrition who will be supporting in identification (Community\nBased Surveillance), education and referral of malnourished children to the health facilities from their respective communities and\nprovision of food supplements to the severely malnourished children. Nutrition education activities will be ongoing with volunteers\nthrough drama, cooking demonstrations and promotion of backyard gardens in areas where water is available. ZRCS will coordinate\nNutrition activities with UN agencies i.e. UNICEF and WFP in addition to working with Ministry of Health at all levels.\nCommunity Engagement Accountability: \nZRCS has a CEA focal person who will spearhead the activities using the systems already set on community feedback. In some of the\naffected Districts, volunteers are trained in CEA and refresher training will be conducted using already set up systems. Feedback and\ncomplaints will be collected through community volunteers, community meetings, focus group discussions and suggestion boxes and\nresponses provided through community meetings. In addition, A hot line (7373) has been established from a local network provider for\nthe purpose of receiving community feedback and identify rumors and misconceptions associated with support provided. Community\nengagement in the response will be ensured through timely sharing of clear information about response activities, selection criteria and\ndistribution processes with communities through community meetings and assessments. All sensitive feedback will be dealt with one on\none by CEA focal point person who will closely be in tandem with the national CEA protocols and committee. CEA will be integrated in all\nthe phases of the operation.\nProtection Gender and Inclusion:\nThe ZRCS intends to provide support to the affected population with consideration on Protection Gender and inclusion. The\ninterventions including identification of beneficiaries for cash transfer and distribution of items will consider the inclusion. Volunteers\nand staff will also be oriented on mainstreaming PGI throughout the operation. \nCoordination:\nZRCS has an internal coordination mechanism through the Incident Management System which has already been activated by the current\nCholera appeal response. The Drought response will be integrated in the same mechanism as it comprises of all NS Department\u2019s and\npartners (IFRC and NLRC). NS will work closely with affected branches and volunteers through National Disaster Response Teams that will\nbe deployed to the targeted branches. \nExternally, collaboration and coordination will be with Government and UN agencies through the activated clusters and structures at\nDistrict level to avoid duplication of e\ufb00orts and ensuring that aid is provided to all vulnerable populations.\nTargeting Strategy\nTargeting Strategy Supporting Document\nPage 12 / 21\nWho will be targeted through this operation?\nDirect target for the main intervention (FSL, Nutrition,WASH) is 25,000 people but WASH and health promotions and services services\n(educative sessions, hygiene promotions, health prevention, water points] will aimed to reach 160,000 people using volunteers and\nmedia. \nThe response efforts will encompass a wide range of specific target groups, including but not limited to pregnant- women, children,\nfarmers, and the elderly, chronically ill and female and child headed households affected with this drought situation. Additionally, the\nresponse will extend to the general population, ensuring that a comprehensive and inclusive approach is adopted. By addressing the\nneeds of various special groups and the broader community, our goal is to provide effective support and protection to the current food\ninsecurity. This approach aims to leave no one behind and mitigate the drought's impact on all segments of the district's population. The\nresponse will target the whole District population with health and hygiene promotion (RCCE) messages and 4,000 households (20,000\npeople) with food security/livelihood and WASH interventions.\nZRCS plans to prioritize actions in Sinazongwe District which is one of the very high-risk districts across the country based on historical\ndata, latest seasonal forecasts, and current vulnerabilities and IPC Report 2023. Joint assessments are underway to determine the\nsituation moving forward and the plans can be adjusted at any point in time when assessments have been concluded.\nExplain the selection criteria for the targeted population\nThe National Society will aim to reach 20,000 people with Food Security and Livelihood, WASH/Health, and 160,000 people with other\nCross cutting interventions. These sectors are the ones negatively impacted by the drought situation being experienced. Food is expected\nto be scarce and expensive; the water supply will be inadequate and expected to be unsafe for a significant proportion of the population.\nWhile the general economic status is already compromised, drought is likely to worsen the livelihood situation as majority are small\nholder farmers who rely on rainfed crop production, ill vices such as Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) are expected to escalate\nas well.\nKey population of focus in this operation will be child and female headed households, the elderly, pregnant and lactating and Persons\nwith Disabilities (PWDs), chronically ill people as they are they highly vulnerable to such shocks for specific activities such as cash transfer\nprogram and distribution of items. Criteria for targeting beneficiaries on the program by the government guidelines and the process shall\nbe coordinated by Government Ministries and Departments in collaboration with the NS following the laid down procedures and policies\nsuch as PGI and code of conduct. Health and hygiene promotion activities will target the whole population in all the targeted Districts.\nVigorous and thorough assessments will be undertaken to ensure the most affected communities and population areas are given priority.\nTotal Targeted Population\nWomen\n75,955\nRural\n47%\nGirls (under 18)\n6,605\nUrban\n53%\nMen\n71,400\nPeople with disabilities (estimated)\n5%\nBoys (under 18)\n6,040\nTotal targeted population\n160,000\nRisk and Security Considerations\nPlease indicate about potential operation risk for this operations and mitigation actions\nRisk\nMitigation action\nIncreased levels of malnutrition especially among children below\nthe age of 5 years\nSupport MoH in child nutrition intervention:\na) Nutrition screening using MUAC and referrals by volunteers.\nb) Provision of supplementary feeding (where feasible.)\nc) Promotion of exclusive breast feeding by volunteers.\nPage 13 / 21\nFurther spread of the Cholera and Anthrax (zoonotic diseases)\noutbreak due to inadequate water supply for personal and\ndomestic hygiene\nEnsure coordination of the interventions for drought and\nepidemics.\nJoint planning and monitoring with key stakeholders such MoH,\nMoA, Ministry of livestock and Fisheries (MoLF) and DMMU.\nIncrease in cross cutting issues such as SGBV, HIV, crime due to\nsouring economic condition.\nIncorporation of cross cutting issues in the whole operation and\ncapacity strengthening of staff and volunteers on the same.\nNon functionality of markets and increase in basic food\ncommodities prices\nExplore possibility of in-kind food distribution\nProvide cash where markets are functional.\nWorsening Food insecurity\nTraining of farmers in food preservation and conservation for\nimproved nutrition.\nSupport smart agriculture and provision of farm inputs.\nCurrency fluctuation\nTransferring funds to NS in foreign currency.\nPlease indicate any security and safety concerns for this operation\nCurrently the country is stable with no concerns reported.

Source: URC\nWhat happened, where and when?\nSouth America has been hit by droughts for three years. In Uruguay, since 2018, there is presence of droughts in \nagricultural areas and decrease in rainfall as well as increase in temperatures within the summer seasons. Year after \nyear, the state provides a response to this situation, through plans of action that target large producers. However, \nthis year the drought situation has been more complex and it is directly a\ufb00ecting families in several ways such as \nlimiting their access to drinking water.\nThe lack of rainfall at the beginning of the year has caused a signi\ufb01cant reduction in the availability and access \nto water in the country, which has also been a\ufb00ected by the presence of the La Ni\u00f1a phenomenon in the region. \nOn Friday, 20 January 2023, the Uruguayan State, through National Emergency System (SINAE), extended a formal \nrequest to the Uruguayan Red Cross for support in the evaluation and possible response to the current drought.\nAccording to SINAE, initial reports estimate more than 75,000 people a\ufb00ected by this emergency only in the \ufb01ve \nmost a\ufb00ected departments of Tacuaremb\u00f3, Cerro Largo, Florida, Lavalleja, and San Jos\u00e9. Additionally, as per the \ninformation provided by the SINAE, the most pressing situation is related to the lack of access to safe water which \nis limiting the consumption and use of water, as well as maintenance of crops and livestock of approximately 1,300 \nfamilies (5,200 people) located in these departments.\nSince October 2022, the national government, through the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries (MGAP) \ndeclared a state of agricultural emergency for a period of 90 days for the entire country. In January 2023, the state of \nPage 2 / 11\nemergency was extended until the end of April and it was broaden to include livestock, dairy, fruit and/or horticulture, \nagriculture, poultry, beekeeping and forestry. \nAccording to information released by the National Institute of Meteorology (INUMET), the entire country is currently \na\ufb00ected by droughts with 20.51% of the territory, equivalent to 3,623,300 hectares, reported to be under extreme \ndrought. Throughout the national territory, rainfall has not exceeded 10 mm, except for some exceptional areas \nin the east and northeast of the country. On the other hand, INUMET issued a press release forecasting that the \naccumulated rainfall expected from December 2022 to February 2023 would be below normal. At the same time, \nquarterly average temperatures are forecasted to be above normal in most of the country, with a probability of being \nin the upper tercile of 45%. \nThe National Fire Department has already carried out more than 1,100 interventions so far this summer, with a \nrecord of 59 \ufb01res in one day, of which 18 were classi\ufb01ed as serious and 18 people su\ufb00ered total damage to homes.\nDrought situation in the department of Artigas.

Weekly follow-up meetings are held and reports \nhave been submitted to the National Council of Government. The National \nIntervention Team is also active, providing support and monitoring the situa-\ntion.\nRisk  Reduction,  Climate \nAdaptation And Recovery\nA total of 4 branches (San Jos\u00e9, Dolores, Soriano and R\u00edo Negro) are giving talks \nto raise awareness and disseminate key messages on drought and heat wave \nprevention in crowded and tourist areas of their departments.\nCommunity  Engagement \nAnd Accountability\nThe Uruguayan Red Cross has activated the feedback and complaint manage-\nment forms, these forms are implemented in all activities carried out directly \nwith the communities, there is a team for case management and reception of \nsuggestions that provides support and responds to any type of inconvenience, \nquery or complaint.\nThe Uruguayan Red Cross has a Risk and Disaster Management, Finance, \nVolunteer, Resource Mobilization and Communication Department.\nPage 3 / 11\nNational Society Readiness\nThe National Society has approximately 350 volunteers throughout the coun-\ntry.\n \nThe Risk Management Directorate team at Headquarters and its National \nIntervention Team were available since the beginning of the emergency and \nmonitoring the evolution of the droughts, through the activation of the Na-\ntional EOC and always working in coordination with the local branches.\n \nSupplies available:\n- 1 institutional van for the transfer of personnel.\n- 2 vans for transporting materials and supplies.\n- 2 Humanitarian Units ready to provide assistance.\n- Storage warehouse at Headquarters (Montevideo).\nAssessment\nSo far, secondary information and data provided by the National Emergency \nSystem (SINAE) have been used to follow up and monitor the emergency \nsituation. Through this DREF Application, the National Society aims to to carry \nout a general assessment of di\ufb00erent sectors and a detailed assessment of \nwater, sanitation and hygiene promotion.\nCoordination\nSince the declaration of the agricultural emergency, the Uruguayan Red Cross \nhas been in communication and coordination with the National Emergency \nSystem (SINAE). In turn, the branches are working together with the Depart-\nmental Emergency Coordination Centers (CECOED) and are at their disposal.\nResource Mobilization\nThe Resource Mobilization Department has made two agreements with com-\npanies to provide some supplies for volunteer work in the \ufb01eld including:\n- Salus: Donation of water drums (500L).\n- Farmashop: Donation of 250 sunscreens. \nFurther negotiations are expected to take place once the DREF Application for \nresponse (if necessary) has been drawn up following the needs assessment.\nMovement Partners Actions Related To The Current \nEvent\nIFRC\nThe IFRC has a country o\ufb03ce in Argentina to support and assist the Southern \nCone countries, which has maintained close contact and coordination with \nthe Uruguayan Red Cross and the Disaster and Crisis Department of the IFRC \nAmericas regional o\ufb03ce in Panama. Since the beginning of the emergency, \nand with the government's request for support to the National Society, con-\nstant communication and technical assistance has been maintained through \nthe CCD for the Southern Cone for the development of the DREF Application.\nICRC\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) also has o\ufb03ces in Ar-\ngentina and, in addition to carrying out actions within its mandate, such as \nworking with the authorities to integrate, implement and disseminate inter-\nnational humanitarian law and rules on the use of force, it carries out actions \nto develop the National Society's capacity to respond to emergency situations \nin contexts of violence and crisis and to provide Restoring Family Links (RFL) \nservices. So far, the ICRC has been in contact with the CCD for the Southern \nCone, but they have not provided speci\ufb01c support for this emergency.\nPage 4 / 11\nParticipating National Soci-\neties\nThe Uruguayan Red Cross works in close collaboration with the Italian Red \nCross (IRC). Although the IRC has no physical representation in the country, \nthey fund a Youth project with a focus on Climate Change, through which \nseveral branches will provide information to local communities during these \nperiods of drought.\nOther Actors Actions Related To The Current Event\nGovernment has requested \ninternational assistance\nNo\nNational authorities\nThe SINAE (National Emergency System) is a national and decentralized sys-\ntem. In each department, there is a Departmental Emergency Committee \n(CDE) responsible for the formulation of Risk Management policies and strate-\ngies at the local level, in line with SINAE's global policies.\nEach Committee is composed of the following members:\n- Departmental Chief of Police.\n- Detachment Chief of the National Fire Department of the Ministry of the \nInterior.\n- Representative of the Ministry of National Defense.\n- Representative of the Ministry of Social Development.\n- Representative of the Ministry of Public Health.\n- Representative of the Institute for Children and Adolescents of Uruguay.\n- Legal Prosecutor of the General Prosecutor's O\ufb03ce of the Nation.\nUnder the coordination of each CDE is the Departmental Emergency Co-\nordination Center (CECOED), which is the operational coordination area for \nIntegral Risk Management. Each CECOED has a coordinator. This is an o\ufb03cial \nappointed by the respective Mayor.\nSince December 2022, the Uruguayan Red Cross has a framework cooperation \nagreement signed with SINAE. \nOn 20 January 2023, SINAE requested support from the Uruguayan Red Cross \nthrough a formal note, to carry out detailed assessments of the needs of \nthe communities that are most a\ufb00ected and in the most remote areas of the \ncountry. \nSINAE (National Emergency Service) is providing a response to the families \nmost a\ufb00ected by the droughts. The response is based on the distribution of \nsafe water to people with little or no access to water. So far, the government \nhas distributed drinking water with tanker trucks that travel to the a\ufb00ected \nareas once a week.\nThe National Emergency System (SINAE), through the di\ufb00erent Emergency \nCoordination Centers (CECOED) and the National Fire Department, has been \nworking to combat the \ufb01res caused by the combination of drought and high \ntemperatures.\nUN or other actors\nAre there major coordination mechanisms in place?\nPage 5 / 11\nOperational Strategy\nOverall objective of the operation\nThrough this DREF Application, the Uruguayan Red Cross aims to conduct a damage and needs assessment on the \ncurrent drought situation in Tacuaremb\u00f3, Cerro Largo, Florida, Lavalleja and San Jos\u00e9, which are reported to be the \n\ufb01ve most-a\ufb00ected departments in the country. The results of the assessments will provide the National Society with \ndetailed information to inform humanitarian planning and decision-making to respond to the emergency.\nOperation strategy rationale\nThis intervention will be designed in a participatory approach to conduct the assessments in coordination with \nthe government authorities and the branches of the di\ufb00erent selected departments. To ensure good coordination, \nmeetings will be held in order to share the structure of the assessment and adjust it to the information needs of all \nthe participating actors. On the other hand, the National Society will work together with the CECOEDs (Departmental \nEmergency Operations Centers), which will facilitate access to local communities and share information already \ncollected. \nThe assessment will use a sampling approach with adequate representation of community groups in the targeted \ndepartments. The assessment process will involve participatory methodologies including interviews with key in-\nformants such as governmental actors, community representatives, and other organizations (if any), focus group \ndiscussions, and visits for direct observation and cross-checking of data with secondary information. All population \ngroups will also be included in the assessment for better community representation.\n \nThe National Society will conduct these assessments in three to four weeks and will work with the HQ team, members \nof the National Intervention Team, and volunteers from branches close to the a\ufb00ected areas. A request is also \nincluded to deploy a surge pro\ufb01le who will support the technical assembly of the survey, analysis of data collected in \nthe assessments, and development of the \ufb01nal report as well as providing recommendations in case of proceeding \nwith a DREF Application for drought response. \nThis assessment will work in conjunction with a CEA strategy and the dissemination of key messages related to \ndrought issues, sharing information related to drought and high-temperature prevention measures, responsible \nwater use, and messages for children and adolescents.\nThe Uruguayan Red Cross has previous experience in response to droughts (e.g. 2018 DREF) where the coordinated \nand collaborative work with the National Emergency System (SINAE) and its Departmental Emergency Coordination \nCenters (CECOED) has facilitated the identi\ufb01cation of areas a\ufb00ected. For this reason, this DREF for assessment \ninvolves a collaborative work with local authorities since the \ufb01rst moment of the organization of the survey in order \nto guarantee joint e\ufb00orts and maximize the outcome of the assessments.\u00a0\nThe Uruguayan Red Cross has established a training and capacity replication system, which allows the sta\ufb00 or \nvolunteers who participate in training or response experiences to replicate the capacities to the rest of the National \nSociety, while monitoring is carried out through the National Intervention Teams (NIT). Additionally, there is currently \none IM pro\ufb01le with previous experience in assessments who will provide support to the team that collects the \ninformation in the \ufb01eld. Therefore, only a surge pro\ufb01le will be requested to support with processing and analyzing \nthe data collected as well as developing the \ufb01nal report.\nAt the end of the operation, a lessons learned workshop will be held to report on best practices and areas for \nimprovement for future experiences.\nTargeting Strategy\nPage 6 / 11\nWho will be targeted through this operation?\nThis operation will focus on conducting a detailed assessment targeting the \ufb01ve most-a\ufb00ected departments of the \ncountry. The National Society will pay special attention to the, at least, 1,300 families (5,200 people) that, according \nto SINAE, have been directly a\ufb00ected by droughts, and are currently with little or no access to drinking water. The \ngeographical targeting for the assessment is determined by the currently available secondary information and data \nin terms of severity.\nExplain the selection criteria for the targeted population\nThe following selection criteria will be used to prioritize the needs assessment within drought-a\ufb00ected communities \nin the selected departments: \n- Families residing in populated areas\n- Families with access to water distributed by the di\ufb00erent Departmental Emergency Coordination Centers (CE-\nCOED).\n- Families in a context of vulnerability and single-parent or female-headed households. \n- Families with elderly people, children, or people with disabilities.\n- Families in a migratory context\nThe needs of all population groups will be considered taking into account age, sex, gender, and people with \ndisabilities, or special needs or requirements.\nRisk and security considerations\nPlease indicate about potential operational risk for this operations and mitigation actions\nRisk\nMitigation action\nThe di\ufb03culty of access to remote areas.\nThere will be a vehicle prepared to enter this type of \nterrain and coordination will be made with SINAE for the \nuse of vehicles or trucks prepared for this type of soil if \nnecessary.\nIncrease or permanence of heat waves during the oper-\nation\nRecommendations will be prepared and shared with all \npersonnel involved in the operation. These recommen-\ndations will serve to prevent any incident such as heat \nstroke. Hydration and protective equipment (sunscreen \nor hats) will also be provided for all personnel.\nLack of scarce integration of the communities in the \nexecution of possible future actions.\nCommunity commitment and responsibility will be en-\nsured through feedback mechanisms.\nA low number of volunteers due to holidays.\nThere will be a survey of volunteers in the subsidiaries \nnear the a\ufb00ected areas to assist the operation with per-\nsonnel or volunteers from other subsidiaries who can \ntravel to support the activities of this operation.\nPlease indicate any security and safety concerns for this operation\nWith regard to the main safety problems that may arise in this operation, include:\n- Di\ufb03culties related to the health of personnel and volunteers due to the e\ufb00ect of heat waves \n- Risks related to driving on the routes between the di\ufb00erent destinations to be evaluated.\nTo mitigate this type of risk, the National Society will provide the necessary protective equipment to each person \nparticipating in the operation and will have personnel trained in \ufb01rst aid at the activities to respond to any \ninconvenience that may arise. The National Society also has a vehicle and driving safety plan and will only use \nauthorized and trained drivers to drive institutional vehicles.\nPage 7 / 11\nPlanned Intervention\nHealth\nBudget\nCHF 511\nTargeted Persons\nIndicators\nTarget\nPriority Actions:\n- First aid supplies (for \ufb01rst aid kits in four vehicles)\nSecretariat Services\nBudget\nCHF 17,200\nTargeted Persons\nIndicators\nTarget\nPriority Actions:\n- Monitoring missions\n- 1x Surge Humanitarian Information Analysis O\ufb03cer\nNational Society \nStrengthening\nBudget\nCHF 25,241\nTargeted Persons\nIndicators\nTarget\nPriority Actions:\n- Support for sta\ufb00 that will carry out the Detailed Needs Assess-\nment (3x sta\ufb00).\n- Support for volunteers that will carry out the Detailed Needs \nAssessment (30x volunteers).\n- Purchase of equipment for assessments (3x tablets).\n- Purchase of personal protective equipment for sta\ufb00 and volun-\nteers.\n- Data collection and analysis workshop (ODK - KoBo).\n- Lessons learned workshop.\nAbout Support Services\nHow many sta\ufb00 and volunteers will be involved in this operation.

Situation Analysis  \n \nDescription of the disaster  \n \nSince 2017, the country has been facing one of the worst drought crises ever since the 1990s. Rains continue to be \nrare, and production does not even cover 1% of the country's food needs. The majority of the Cape Verdean population \nlives from agriculture (22% of the active population is employed by the agricultural sector, of which 82% is in rural \nareas). This situation leads 24.2% of the population to live in poverty and 9.2% in extreme poverty. \n \nEmergency Action Plan (EPoA) \nCape Verde: Drought  \n \nP a g e  | 2 \n \n \nInternal \n \nFarmers find it more and more difficult to continue their productive \nactivities. After more than four seasons of considerable rainfall deficit, \nagricultural productivity yields have deteriorated considerably and \naquifers did not recharge, which affects access to water for the \npopulation and their livelihood activities. \n \nThe 2021-2022 agro pastoral campaign was characterized by a late \nstart and an early end to the rains, throughout the national territory. \nOverall agricultural production varies from low to nil, depending on \nthe agro-climatic strata of the municipalities. Cereal production is \nestimated at 640 tons of maize, recording an 80% decrease, \ncompared to the average of the last 5 years. As for bean production, \nit has fallen by 90% compared to the average of the last 5 years, and \nstands at 197 tons.1 \n \nAs a result, the Government of Cape Verde has declared, on 16 \nFebruary 2022, the situation of national drought emergency \ndisaster. This was contrary to the forecasts of the Agrhymet Center \nwhich predicted a campaign with a rainfall varying from normal to \nexcess and a regular to early start for the Sahel region. \n \nAt the national level, production of fodder has been regular to low, \nand data show that the situation is normal in the southern islands and \nweak in the northern islands, where the most critical situation is in the \nmunicipality of Porto Novo, on the island of Santo Ant\u00e3o. The \nphytosanitary situation was characterized by the strong and localized \nattack of the \u201cOedaleus Senegalensis\u201d locust on the islands of \nSantiago, Maio, Fogo and Brava. There was also a widespread attack \nof the \"green bug\" on maize and bean crops. \n \nGiven the adverse conditions linked to the agro-pastoral agricultural campaign, some municipalities in the country are \nin a situation of acute food insecurity. The results of the Harmonized Framework (March 2022), presented as part of \nthe Regional Food Crisis Prevention and Management System (PREGEC) held 28 - 30 March 2022 show a current \nsituation of food insecurity affecting 29,421 people in the phase of crisis (Ph 3), and 1,076 people in the \nemergency phase (Ph 4), mainly on the island of Santiago (in the municipality of Ribera Grande, which was the only \none recorded in phase 3), and a projected situation for this year's lean period (June to August 2022) of 46,093 \npeople in food insecurity (10% of the population) including 43,003 in crisis (Ph 3) and 3,090 in the emergency \nphase (Ph 4)2. \n \nFrom June to August 2022, 4 municipalities will be in phase 3 (crisis), namely: Porto Novo on the island of Santo Ant\u00e3o, \nand Sao Domingos, Santa Cruz and Ribeira Grande on the island of Santiago. Considering the current situation and \nthe anticipated situation, it is important to start a number of response and preparedness actions while putting in place \nanticipatory measures to limit the impact of the projected drought and reduce the vulnerability of the most vulnerable \npopulations at risks mentioned above. \n \n1 Source: Presentation - Harmonized Framework for Analysis and Identification of Areas at Risk and Estimation of Food Insecure Populations in Cabo Verde, \nPraia, March 7-11, 2022 \n2 Source: Communication sheet CH de Cabo Verde \"Harmonized framework for identifying areas and estimating populations in acute food and nutrition insecurity \nin Cabo Verde - Current situation (March-April-May 2022) and projected (June- July-August 2022)\", March 2022 \n \nImage : Bulletin Officiel de la R\u00e9publique du \nCap Vert (16 f\u00e9vrier 2022) \n \nP a g e  | 3 \n \n \nInternal \nPhasing \nZones \nPopulation \nPopulation (%) \nCurrent \nProjected \nCurrent \nProjected \nCurrent \nProjected \nPh1 \n4 \n2 \n346,464 \n299,473 \n72 \n62 \nPh2 \n17 \n16 \n106,666 \n138,062 \n22 \n29 \nPh3 \n1 \n4 \n29,421 \n4,3003 \n6 \n9 \nPh4 \n0 \n0 \n1,076 \n3,090 \n0,2 \n1 \nPh5 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0,0 \n0 \nTotal \n22 \n22 \n483,627 \n483,628 \n100 \n100 \n \nSource: Analysis of the harmonized framework - March 2022. Results of the analysis of the harmonized framework \u00e9 \n(March 2022) on the current situation and the projected situation (June to August 2022). \n \nSummary of the current intervention  \n \nOverview of Host National Society action \n \nThe Red Cross Society of Cape Verde (RCSCV), through its local branches and in close collaboration and cooperation \nwith the decentralized structures of the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment and the municipal coordination bodies \nof the areas, participates in the various coordination meetings set up by the Cape Verdean government, including the \nworkshops of the harmonized framework at national level. \n \nRCCV has experience in the implementation of DREF operations3 and in food security and nutrition. The National \nSociety (NS) teams have both theoretical and practical skills in the area of food security and livelihoods (SAME), thanks \nto an in-depth assessment carried out in 2018 on the islands of Santiago and Santo Ant\u00e3o. This evaluation mobilized \nseveral volunteers and staff from RCCV and counted on the support of two staff sent by the Livelihood Center (CME) \nhosted by the Spanish Red Cross. \n \nDuring the COVID 19 pandemic, RCCV mobilized more than 300 volunteers to provide food assistance to vulnerable \npeople who were in lockdown. \n \nThe NS team is composed of one ERU WASH and FACT, 7 RDRT members, 60 NDRT members and more than 450 \nCommunity Disaster Response Team (CDRT) members of all backgrounds. As part of this operation, it is planned  to \nmobilize around 250 volunteers, including 3 in general coordination, a volunteer specialist in food security and \nlivelihoods (SAME), and all the support services (finance and logistics) of the Secretariat. Field activities will be carried \nout on different fronts in accordance with the main lines of action defined in the operational strategy. \n \nRCCV actively participates in Sahel+ initiatives, including the Migration and SAME technical groups. During the last \ngeneral assembly of the Sahel+, held in March 2022 in The Gambia, the RCCV were chairing the network. \n \nOverview of the action of the RCRC Movement in the country \n \nThere is no representation of the Red Cross Movement in Cape Verde. The RCCV receives technical and financial \nsupport from Partner National Societies (PNS - Spanish, Luxembourg, and Canadian Red Cross Societies), from ICRC \nand from the Federation. The IFRC will ensure regular support is provided to the NS to respond to this disaster and \nregular coordination will be put in place. The Spanish Red Cross has funded various projects in the field of food \nsecurity, in particular between 1997 and 2000. Following the drought situation and the 2017 \u2013 2018 poor agricultural \nseasons, the Spanish Red Cross assisted the NS in carrying out field assessments and analysing the data collected. \nThe Luxembourg and Canadian Red Cross Societies, provided support in the fight against COVID-19 and disaster \npreparedness and response, etc. \n \nA cash and voucher assistance specialist from the Burkinabe Red Cross will be mobilized through the British Red \nCross' Cash School to build the team\u2019s capacities in the area and support the contracting process with the Financial \nServices Provider. \n \nThe NS also receives funding from the UK government (Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office-FCDO), \nthrough the Risk-Based Early Action Partnership (REAP) whose Secretariat is hosted by the IFRC. This project, with \n \n3 In 2014, Operation DREF Fogo Volcano of CHF 119,069, targeting 2,500 people; and in 2009, Operation DREF Dengue Outbreak of CHF 153,951, targeting 75,000 \npeople. \nP a g e  | 4 \n \n \nInternal \nthe technical support of the IFRC, falls within the framework of REAP target 1, \"50 countries can review and integrate \ntheir laws, policies and/or crisis/disaster risk management plans and climate adaptation, to ensure that they reduce \nthe impacts of climate change and the exposure of people and the environment\".  \n \nThe specific objectives of the project are to: \ni) \nDevelop the capacities of key stakeholders, operating at the junction of disasters and climate; \nii) \nSupport the development of national regulatory frameworks for disaster risk management adapted to \nclimate change, which responds to the needs of the most vulnerable and involves local communities; \niii) \nShare best practices and promote recommendations to develop more coherent legal and policy \nframeworks for disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA). \n \nOverview of external Red Cross/Red Crescent actors in the country \n \nFor this emergency, the Cape Verdean Government has opted for the approval and implementation of an \"Emergency \nprogramme for the mitigation of the drought and the poor 2021/2022 agricultural Year \" (Resolution No. 13 /2022 of 16 \nFebruary, 2022) based on 3 major groups of measures to be implemented: \n\u2022 \nLivestock rescue: protect the breeding activity and ensure the conditions for the maintenance of ruminant \nbreeding. \n\u2022 \nManagement of water shortage: addressing the problem of water shortage by ensuring rational use and \nregularity of supply for households and agricultural and livestock holdings. \n\u2022 \nJob creation for affected families: protection of livelihoods with special attention to the most vulnerable \nfamilies (women and young people). \n \nThe Government of Cape Verde also benefits from the technical support of NGOs and UN agencies such as Action \nagainst Hunger (ACF), OXFAM and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and financial \nsupport from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the French Development Agency (AFD) \nand the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). \n \nNeeds analysis, beneficiary selection, scenario planning and risk assessment \n \nAnalysis of the Needs  \n \nCape Verde is an archipelago of ten islands \nand thirteen islets, located approximately 450 \nkm from Senegal.  It has an area of 4,033 \nkm2 and an exclusive economic zone \nestimated at 700,000 km2. Natural resources \nare scarce, the vast majority of soils are poor \nin organic matter and only 10% of land is \npotentially arable. Since its independence in \n1975, Cape Verde has been resolutely \ncommitted to the fight against desertification \nand the effects of drought. \n \nRainfall is generally low throughout the \ncountry, not exceeding 300 mm annual \naverage for 65% of the territory located at \nless than 400 m altitude. The areas under the \ninfluence of the trade winds being even drier \n(150 mm annual average). On the slopes \nlocated at more than 500 m of altitude facing \nthe trade winds, it can reach or exceed 700 \nmillimetres. \n \nSince 2017, the rainy seasons have been \nmore and more irregular and insufficient, and has impacted the availability of water and agricultural yield (agriculture \nand livestock) which have been considerably reduced as indicated by the declaration of the situation of national \ndisaster announced by the Government on 16 February, 2022. \n \nSource: Cape Verde Harmonised Framework Communication Sheet - \nProjected situation from June to August 2022 \nHarmonised Framework: analysis of acute food and nutrition insecurity \nprojected situation; June-July-August 2022 \nP a g e  | 5 \n \n \nInternal \nAccording to the Government4, given the results of the Harmonized Framework of March 2022, the number of people \nestimated to be in severe food insecurity (phases 3, 4) for the lean season (between June and August 22) amounts \nto 46,093 people, i.e., 9,218 households (10% of the population), including 43,003 in crisis (Ph 3) and 3,090 in \nemergency phase (Ph 4). \n \nThe areas most affected by this food insecurity, for the projected period, are the localities of Porto Novo (in Santo \nAnt\u00e3o), Santa Cruz, Ribeira Grande and Sao Domingo (in the island of Santiago). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe number of people (and households) at risk of food insecurity (Ph 2), is quite high, 138,062 people, or 27,612 \nhouseholds (29% of the population). \nThese figures refer to vulnerable populations affected by the climate shock (drought) and the COVID-19 \npandemic. To prevent the situation of affected population that are already under pressure/stress from worsening and \nmoving into phase 3 (crisis), the food insecurity of these populations must be monitored5.  \n \nLivelihoods and basic needs \nThe drought is compromising the food, nutritional, and economic security of households in these areas, jeopardizing \ntheir ability to meet their basic needs in the coming months and to invest in their livelihoods to ensure the continuity of \nthe agricultural season (after one \u201cfailed\u201dbad season, 2021-2022).  \nFood insecurity and malnutrition are likely to affect mainly small-scale farmers who have not recorded any production \ndue to the low diversification of their household economy, with a focus on female-headed households. \nFollowing the recommendations set out in the analysis of the Harmonized Framework6 for mitigating food insecurity \nforecasts and depletion of productive assets, in the short term, the priority needs of affected households are as follows: \n\u2022 \nCovering food needs during the peak of the lean season (June to September) to avoid depletion of assets and \nproductive assets; \n\u2022 \nThe provision of feed for animals (remaining herds of small ruminants) and support for destocking by slaughter; \n\u2022 \nThe need for assistance to help secure the livelihoods (agriculture and livestock) of the most vulnerable \npopulations during the next agricultural season. \n \nThe country has been experiencing several factors over the past three years that have disrupted the local market and \ncreated inflation in certain goods and services. In particular, the low agricultural production observed in recent years, \nthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the crisis in Ukraine have affected the markets for imported products, as is \nthe case for Cape Verde. The level of supply of agricultural products to the markets is generally more or less normal \nand regular.

The negative effects of malnutrition are \nparticularly felt among children aged 0-59 months) and pregnant or lactating women. \n \nFood insecurity is a major contributing factor to acute malnutrition, combined with inadequate food intake, low dietary \ndiversity among children and women, and a high prevalence of diseases (diarrhea, ARI, and malaria) linked to limited \naccess to water and health services. The COVID-19 epidemic was also an unusual shock, exacerbating malnutrition. \n \nWater, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) \n \nThe targeted communities face the problems of water scarcity, deterioration of existing water sources and dry \nagricultural land. They do not have access to good quality drinking water for their own consumption and for livestock \nand agriculture. Many people have to travel for many kilometres to find water for drinking or use tankers to irrigate their \nfields and give water to their livestock. Given the cost of water, many prefer to sell their livestock. It is therefore crucial \nto ensure that existing water points, which are already inadequate, are protected. \n \nProtection, gender and inclusion (PGI) \n \nThe duration of the crisis, and the time of exposure to the lack of means to provide families with basic needs, puts \npressure on heads of households, especially in the case of single-parent households or households with a high \ndependency ratio, and mainly those headed by women, disabled and elderly persons, with a greater workload or fewer \nresources to meet household needs. \n \nCommunity Engagement and Accountability (CEA) \n \nAffected populations should be consulted and involved in the needs assessment, the identification of response options, \nwhile we consider their perception on how these options match their needs. The first step is to identify the best \ncommunication channels to effectively inform communities and individuals about the targets and objectives of the \nhumanitarian assistance. The best way to collaborate with affected communities must then be determined according \nto the context and the feedback received. \n \nTargeting  \n \nThe RCCV will concentrate the humanitarian assistance in Ribeira Grande de Santiago, on the island of Santiago, and \nin Porto Novo, on the island of Santo Ant\u00e3o, as these two localities are the most affected (now and later on in June to \nAugust based on projections) by the drought and present a major risk of food insecurity cases in crisis and emergency. \nIt is projected that in these two locations, 6,026 people (1,205 households) would be severely food insecure between \nJune and August 2022, either in crisis (4,448 people) or emergency (1,578 people).  \n \nThe proposed targeting by intervention sector is as follows: \n \nSector \n \nActivities \nTarget \nLivelihoods and basic \nneeds  \nResponse actions \nFood assistance (cash transfers) \n400 households (2,000 \npeople \nAnticipated actions \nSupport to farmers (cash transfers \nfor purchase of seeds and fertilizer) \n100 households (500 \npeople) \n \nAnticipated actions \nSupport to livestock farmers (cash \ntransfers) for the purchase of feed \nand support for animal vaccination \n100 households (500 \npeople) \n \nResponse actions \nSupport for destocking through \nslaughter \n50 households (250 people) \n \nResponse/ preparation \n \nAwareness sessions for farmers and \nherders \n500 people \n \nHealth \nResponse/ preparation \n \nMalnutrition screening campaigns \n1,000 people \n \nResponse/ preparation \n \n \nDistribution of nutritional \nsupplements for a period of \nthree months \n200 people (children from 6 \nto 59 months and/or \npregnant and lactating \nwomen) \nP a g e  | 7 \n \n \nInternal \n \nResponse/ preparation \n \nAwareness sessions and cooking \ndemonstrations \n500 people \nWater, sanitation and \nhygiene (WASH) \nAnticipated actions \nRepair and maintenance of tanks, \nwells and/or boreholes in identified \nlocalities \n6,026 people \nAnticipated and response \nactions \nDistribution of buckets and jerry \ncans \n500 households (2,500 \npeople) \n \nAnticipated and response \nactions \nHygiene promotion and awareness \nactivities \n500 households (2,500 \npeople) \n \nProtection, gender \nand inclusion (PGI) \nResponse/ preparation \n \nCross-cutting actions for the entire \ntarget population \n6,026 people \nCommunity \nEngagement and \nAccountability (CEA) \nResponse/ preparation \n \nImplementation of the community \nfeedback mechanism \n6,026 people \n \nFurther evaluation during the implementation of this DREF will allow to adjust the number of people targeted, if \nnecessary by municipality, and provide disaggregated data.

There are \nno product shortages. According to the Agence de \nR\u00e9gulation des Produits Pharmaceutiques et \nAlimentaires (ARFA), grain availability is estimated \nat approximately 5,419.50 tons \nThe government has declared a \nstate of emergency throughout the \ncountry. \n \nThe RCCV responds to the most \nurgent needs through the \nimplementation of anticipatory \nactions in the face of the impending \ncrisis, through a DREF operation. \n \nThe RCCV continues to monitor the \nsituation, coordinating with partners \nin food safety groups and \nauthorities. \n \nRCCV develops a medium-to-long-\nterm food security and livelihoods \naction plan to address recurring \ndrought conditions. \nScenario 2 \n \nThe effects of the \ndrought are \nsomewhat greater \nthan predicted in the \nHarmonized \nFramework and the \nsituation deteriorates \ndespite the \nanticipatory actions \nput in place.  \n \n \n \nDeterioration of the food intake and nutritional \nstatus of the population, particularly for children \nunder five, with very likely negative consequences \non their health. \n \nSignificant loss of households livelihoods. \n \nDeterioration of livelihood protection and recovery \nwhich will not allow households to recover for the \nnext agricultural season. \n \nWASH situation deteriorates due to insufficient or \nlack of water. \n \nIncrease in market prices of foodstuffs. \n \nWomen, in particular, are caught in an endless cycle \nof debt. \n \nThe government is intensifying its \nactions nationwide.  \n \nThe RCCV updates and revises the \nDREF operation to respond to the \nincreased needs of the population. \n \nIFRC provides increased support to \nRCCV through the Dakar \ndelegation, including the \ndeployment of a Food Security and \nLivelihoods delegate. \n \nP a g e  | 8 \n \n \nInternal \nThe resilience of vulnerable households at national \nlevel is deteriorating. \nScenario 3 \n \nThe negative \neffects of the \ndrought far exceed \nthe predictions of \nthe Harmonized \nFramework and the \nsituation reaches a \ncatastrophic level  \nThere are several deaths in the country due to \nextreme famine. \n \nDrastic increase in cases of malnutrition. \n \nDisplacement of population. \n \nThe government renews its request \nfor assistance from UN agencies \nand international regional NGOs. \n \nRequest for the launch of an \nEmergency Appeal by the RCCV \nand activation of the IFRC's global \ntools. \n \n \nThe following factors will be assessed on an ongoing basis so that response options can be adapted as the situation \nchanges: \n \n\u2022 \nRainfall level; \n\u2022 \nLevel of increase in the market price of foodstuffs; \n\u2022 \nLevel of indebtedness of the population; \n\u2022 \nNumber of livestock deaths; \n\u2022 \nNumber of cases of malnutrition recorded; \n\u2022 \nNumber of displaced persons to less vulnerable communities; \n\u2022 \nNumber of deaths due to famine. \n \nAssessment of the risks associated with the operation  \nRisk \n \nControl \nThe lack of qualified human resources in the affected \nareas to meet the increased needs. \n  \nRCCV will mobilize more volunteers in the affected \nbranches and organize additional training sessions to \nsupport this operation. \nDrought conditions will continue throughout the year \nand the situation may worsen in the targeted \ncommunities even during the rainy season. \nRCCV through its branches and partners continues to \nmonitor the situation and provide assistance to the most \nvulnerable as best it can. RCCV is also developing a \nmedium-to-long-term food security and livelihoods \naction plan to better address the recurrence of drought \nconditions. \n \nDelays in the availability of funds for the distribution of \ncash transfers and other assistance items to \nbeneficiaries have a negative impact on the timely \ndelivery of humanitarian aid. \n \nThe RCCV commits its own emergency funds to start \nthe operation immediately after the DREF is launched. \nIn the event of a significant delay in the timeliness of \nfunds, an extension of time may be requested. \nThe lack of a framework agreement between a financial \nservice provider and the NS slows the implementation \nof the cash transfer programme and causes delays in \nthe distribution of humanitarian assistance to \nbeneficiaries. \n \n \n \nSupport from the British Red Cross Cash School is \nbeing provided through the deployment of a Cash and \nVoucher Assistance Specialist to Cape Verde for a \nperiod of six weeks beginning April 21, 2022. This \nsupport facilitates and accelerates the identification of a \nfinancial service provider that meets the needs of the \noperation and the IFRC's implementation standards. \nDespite the significant decrease in COVID cases in \nCape Verde, the risk of contracting the disease still \nexists and the lack of personal protective equipment \n(PPE) for staff and volunteers increases the risk of \nbeing infected during the community-based activities of \nthe response, resulting in a reduction in RCCV's \noperational capacity at the branch and sub-branch \nlevels.  \nThe RCCV will provide trainings for its staff and \nvolunteers. These trainings will take place in small \ngroups, respecting social distancing measures. \nDistribution exercises will ensure that physical \ndistancing standards are met. \n \nMarket volatility, prices and the impact of the COVID-19 \ncontext and the crisis in Ukraine on basic commodities \nand on WASH materials and agricultural inputs.  \n \n \nA market assessment in the first two weeks of the \noperation is planned, and ongoing market and price \nmonitoring to ensure that activities remain relevant, and \nallocations are sufficient to meet needs. \nP a g e  | 9 \n \n \nInternal \nB. Strategy of the operation \n \nOverall objective \n \nThe overall objective of this appeal is to respond to the immediate needs of the population affected by the \ncurrent drought and reduce their vulnerability to severe food insecurity and malnutrition in the coming \nmonths. This will be done in the localities of Ribeira Grande de Santiago, on the island of Santiago, and \nPorto Novo, on the island of Santo Ant\u00e3o, by providing immediate food assistance, implementing livelihood \npreparedness and protection activities, deploying actions to prevent malnutrition, ensuring better access to \nwater, and raising awareness on hygiene and sanitation issues. \n \nPlanned activities will also allow strengthening RCCV's disaster preparedness and response capacity in the \nareas of food security and cash transfers, and strengthen its national volunteers\u2019 network.  \n \nThis DREF operation aims at implementing and anticipating response activities to an impending crisis. The approach \ndeployed is as follows: \n1) Respond to the urgent needs of the most vulnerable populations and those most at risk of food insecurity \nduring the 2022 lean season (June to August 2022). This will be done through the implementation of \nanticipatory actions in water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), protection and strengthening of livelihoods in \nthe medium term (livestock, crops). \n2) Immediate livelihoods assistance response actions in terms of food and basic needs, and health.  \n \nOperational Strategy \n \nThrough this operation, RCCV aims to prevent and mitigate the consequences of the drought and the poor agricultural \nyears impacting the food and nutrition security situation and the protection of the livelihoods of the most vulnerable \naffected populations.  \n \nA needs assessment in the two target localities, including a market assessment, will precede the implementation of \nsectoral activities. \n \nLivelihoods and basic needs \n \n1. Food assistance for 400 households (2,000 people), for three months, through the implementation of an \nunconditional cash transfer programme \na. The Financial Service Provider will be identified and contracting will be completed with the support of the \nCash School specialist. The RCCV has on other occasions (e.g., COVID-19 response activities) agreed \nto ad hoc contracts with a financial services provider. \nb. The Cash School specialist will also contribute to building the capacity of the National Society through \nsustained support over six weeks, including the organization of training/retraining sessions for staff and \nvolunteers. \nc. Amount to be distributed: 12,350 CVE/month per household, for 3 months (i.e., 37,050 CVE/household), \ncalculated on the basis of the costs of the basic food basket (rice, maize, legumes, sugar, and oil) which \nguarantees the minimum ration of 2,100 kcal/person/day. \n \nItem \nQuantity \nUnit \nKcal/p/d \nPrice/unit (CVE) \nTotal price (CVE) \nGrains (rice, corn, flour, \netc.) \n50 \nkg \n1,210 \n140 \n7,000,00 \nLegume \n25 \nkg \n555 \n150 \n3,750,00 \nOil \n5 \nlitre \n295 \n170 \n850,00 \nSugar \n5 \nkg \n129 \n150 \n750,00 \n  \n \n \n2,189 \n \n12,350,00 \n \nMonthly food basket in Cape Verde for a household of 5 people \n \n2. Support to farmers and livestock breeders through the implementation of a cash transfer programme: \na. For farmers (100 households, 500 people): purchase of seeds and fertilizers. \nb. For herders (100 households, 500 people): purchase of feed and support for access to veterinary care. \nP a g e  | 10 \n \n \nInternal \nc. Amount to be distributed: a single transfer of 8,000 CVE/household. \n3. Additional support to livestock farmers (50 households, 250 individuals) through support for slaughter \ndestocking. \n4. Organization of sensitization sessions for farmers and herders, including in collaboration with the technical \nservices of the Ministry of Agriculture. \nDue to the availability of ATMs in the target areas and the presence of financial services, Cash Transfer Programming \nwill be organized. The implementation of the cash transfer programme will be based on lessons learned by the NS \nfrom previous operations. The British Red Cross Cash School will be supported by the deployment of a Cash and \nVoucher Assistance specialist to Cape Verde for a period of six weeks. This support will facilitate and accelerate the \nidentification of a Financial Service Provider that meets the needs of the operation and the IFRC's implementation \nstandards. \n \nHealth \n \n1. Organization of screening campaigns for malnutrition in the two targeted localities, reaching a total of 1,000 \npeople and allowing for the rapid referral of the most at-risk cases. \n2. Distribution of nutritional supplements for 200 people at risk (children aged 6 to 59 months and/or pregnant \nand lactating women), for a period of three months. \n3. Organization of nutrition awareness sessions and cooking demonstrations in the two target localities, reaching \na total of 500 people. \n \nWater, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) \n \n1. Initial assessment of the water, sanitation and hygiene situation in the two target localities. \n2. To ensure a steady supply of water to drought-affected families for both farm irrigation needs and livestock \nactivities, damaged reservoirs, wells and/or boreholes will be identified and rehabilitated. \na. A total of 12 reservoirs and 12 wells and/or boreholes will be identified and rehabilitated. \n3. Based on current information, communities are familiar with the use of water from boreholes. Restoration and \nmaintenance of damaged reservoirs, wells and/or boreholes are integrated to improve access to safer water. \nDistribution of buckets (14L) and jerry cans (10L) for water collection and storage to 500 households (2,500 \npeople). \na. Each household will receive 1 bucket and 2 jerry cans.  \n4. Water purification needs will be determined during the detailed assessment. For now, pending specific needs \nthat may be identified during the assessment, this involves providing water storage equipment for domestic \nuse, crops, and livestock. Hygiene promotion and awareness activities will be carried out in the two target \nlocalities, reaching 500 households (2,500 people). \n \nProtection, Gender and Inclusion (PGI) \n \n1. The initial needs assessment will help to collect and analyse data disaggregated by sex, age and disability \nstatus. \na. The assessment will pay particular attention to the different and distinct needs of women, girls, and \nboys and to needs by locality. It will identify priority cross-cutting actions in risk reduction and AIP. \n2. All sectors of intervention will seek to meet minimum AIP standards in emergency situations. \n3. Organize capacity building sessions on minimum standards for AIP in emergencies, with the support of the \nRCCV AIP Focal Point. \n4. Develop Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for protection and sexual and gender-based violence, \nincluding a mapping of actors, services and referral pathways. \n \nCommunity Engagement and Accountability (CEA) \n \n1. Community members will be consulted during the initial needs assessment, during the implementation of \nsupport activities, and during post-distribution follow-ups. \n2. Participatory approaches will be used to define and communicate selection criteria and validation, for example \nby working with community committees. \n3. Communities will be consulted and informed about the selection criteria and how they can contact the RCCV.  \na. A community feedback system will be established, including a hotline and follow-up during response \nactivities, to ensure that the views of targeted community members are incorporated. \nP a g e  | 11 \n \n \nInternal \nOperational Support Services \n \nHuman Resources \n \nThe RCCV will involve approximately 250 volunteers and professionals in this operation through its central (General \nSecretariat) and local (Local Councils) structures for approximately 4 months. \nFor sensitization activities, in particular the door-to-door visits to families, it will be necessary, once again, to call upon \nmore volunteers properly trained in sensitization, animation and beneficiary satisfaction survey techniques. \nThis estimate includes not only the beneficiaries in various communities, but also staff from other civil society \norganizations who, together, will contribute to the implementation of planned activities. \nAs part of this operation, a National Operations Coordinator with knowledge of food security and IFRC procedures will \nbe identified. He will report directly to the Director of the Disaster Management Department.  \n \nSimilarly, the RCCV will make available a finance person who will be completely dedicated to this operation. \nTwo counterparts (an Operations Manager with experience in cash and voucher assistance for 3 months and an \nAdministration and Finance profile for 2 months) will also be mobilized by the IFRC through the Rapid Response \nsystem to work with the RCCV on a peer-to-peer support basis. \n \nThe Food Security and Livelihoods delegate from the IFRC delegation in Dakar will also be made available to provide \nsupport to the RCCV, remotely and/or through an ad hoc technical support mission. \n \nLogistics and Supply Chain \n \nLogistics activities will focus on the effective management of the supply chain, including procurement, customs \nclearance, fleet, storage and transportation to distribution sites, in accordance with the requirements of the operation \nand IFRC logistics standards, processes and procedures. \n \nThe local supply chain for communities has been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and local prices are also \nfluctuating due to the crisis in Ukraine. The market and supply chain situation will be monitored by the NS as part of \nthis operation and the impact of international changes on the market, prices and access to goods and services needed \nfor food security in the country will be updated in the national contingency plan.  \n \nWith regard to material purchases under this operation, the NS will monitor prices and address any fluctuations that \nrequire a review or change in purchasing strategy. For the 3 months of operations, the RCCV will need field support \nto carry out the response. \n \nCommunication \n \nRCCV will share regular information and updates on the operation with key stakeholders. The operations manager will \nbe responsible for communication with external stakeholders. At operational level, the RCCV and IFRC will undertake \ncommunication activities to increase the visibility of the NS and demonstrate the impact of the Movement's contribution, \nincluding communications with media. The IFRC will support the documentation and publication of the stories on the \nIFRC website and the Go platform. \n \nInformation Technology (IT) \n \nTelephone calls and online communications are already underway between the technical departments at RCCV \nheadquarters and the IFRC, with government stakeholders and other partners. These exchanges will continue \nthroughout the operation to ensure the follow-up of the activities and to monitor the evolution of the situation. \n \nSecurity \n \nCape Verde is a country with stable security and no particular risk. However, in recent years there has been an increase \nin petty assaults and snatchings, particularly in Praia and Tarrafal de Santiago, also, to a lesser extent, in places with \nhigh tourist traffic (Mindelo in S\u00e3o Vicente, Santa Maria in Sal and Sal Rei in Boa Vista). \n \nRestrictions related to the application of sanitary measures in Cape Verde: since March 6, 2022, the state of sanitary \nemergency has been lifted and the Cape Verdean territory has been placed on alert. In this context, the following \nmeasures apply to everyone: the wearing of a mask (that remains recommended outdoor) is mandatory in all closed \nspaces, except for discotheques; to access events with more than 20 people, a certificate of recovery or complete \nvaccination against Covid-19 (with a mandatory booster dose if the last dose of this complete vaccination scheme is \nP a g e  | 12 \n \n \nInternal \nmore than 270 days) or proof of screening (PCR test of less than 72 hours or antigenic test of less than 48 hours) with \na negative test result must be presented. \n \nAll Red Cross Red Crescent personnel actively involved in operations must have completed the IFRC online Stay Safe \ncourses (personal safety, safety management or volunteer safety). The safety of the responders will be ensured \nthrough appropriate equipment and briefings on the risks associated with the operation and the COVID-19 \nenvironment. \n \nPlanning, Monitoring, Evaluation and reporting (PMER) \n \nOngoing monitoring will be carried out at country level and with IFRC. The RCCV will strive to ensure collaboration \nwith other Movement partners who will monitor the progress of the operation and provide the necessary technical \nexpertise. \n \nThe RCCV will ensure the monitoring and reporting of the operation. Brief weekly updates will be provided to the IFRC \nand other partners as relevant on the overall progress of the operation. Periodic reports defined in the funding \nagreements will provide details on the monitoring of indicators. \n \nPost-distribution monitoring will be conducted one week after the end of distributions. \n \nA DREF review will be conducted to assess the impact of this operation and a lessons learned workshop will also be \nheld as part of learning process. \n \nAdministration and Finance \n \nThe National Society has a permanent administration and finance department. A finance person will be fully dedicated \nto this operation. \n \nConsistent with the lessons learned from the RCCV's response to COVID-19, an Administration and Finance profile \nwill be mobilized through the Rapid Response system to strengthen the National Society's capacity and ensure \ncompliance with financial administrative procedures in accordance with the terms and conditions to be addressed in \nthe agreement between the NS and the IFRC. \n \n \n   \n \n \nP a g e  | 13 \n \n \nInternal \nC.

They do not have access to \ngood quality drinking water for their own consumption and for livestock and agriculture. Many people have to travel several kilometres to find drinking water or use \ntankers to irrigate their fields and give water to their livestock. Given the cost of water, many prefer to sell the livestock. It is therefore crucial to ensure that existing \nwater points, which are already insufficient, are protected. \n \nThe RCCV will implement a package of WASH activities in each target area, ensuring improved and sustainable access to safe water for people and livestock in \nunderserved and at-risk rural communities. Access to water will be improved through the rehabilitation of water points, shallow wells and pumping equipment (including \nthe installation of solar pumping systems). \n \nThe RCCV will promote hygiene and sanitation in the target areas by training volunteers and conducting awareness campaigns. Key messages on the prevention and \ntransmission of COVID-19 will be integrated into hygiene promotion. \n \nPopulation to be assisted:  \n\u2022 \nRepair and maintenance of tanks, wells and/or boreholes in identified localities: 6,026 people \n\u2022 \nDistribution of buckets and jerry cans: 1,000 households (5,000 people) \n\u2022 \nHygiene promotion and awareness activities: 500 households (2,500 people) \n \nImplementation standards: SPHERE Minimum standards. \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nP a g e  | 17 \n \n \nInternal \nP&B \nOutput \nCode  \n \n \n \nWASH Outcome 1: Immediate reduction in risk of waterborne diseases in targeted \ncommunities  \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n# of people reached by awareness raising activities \n(target: 80%) \n \n \nWASH Output 1.1: Detailed assessment of the water, sanitation and hygiene situation is \nconducted in target communities \n \n# of WASH assessments conducted (target: 2) \nPlanned activities \nWeek / Month \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 \n16 \n AP026 \nConduct an initial assessment of the water, sanitation and hygiene \nsituation in target communities \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n AP026 \nMonitor the water, sanitation and hygiene situation in target \ncommunities \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nP&B \nProduct \nCode \nWASH output 1.2: Daily access to safe water in quantity and quality that meets Sphere and \nWHO standards is ensured for the target population \n# of tanks rehabilitated (target: 12) \n# of wells or boreholes rehabilitated (target: 12) \n# of buckets distributed (target: 500) \n# of jerry cans distributed (target: 1,000) \nPlanned activities \nWeek / Month \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 \n16 \nAP026 \nTank repair and maintenance \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nAP026 \nRepair and maintenance of wells and/or boreholes \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAP026 \nDistribution of buckets and jerry cans \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nP&B \nProduct \nCode \n \nWASH product 1.4: Hygiene promotion activities that meet Sphere standards for \nidentification and use of hygiene products provided to the target population  \n \n# of volunteers trained (target: 40) \n# of awareness sessions (target: 10) \n# households reached with key messages to promote \npersonal and community hygiene (target: 500) \nPlanned activities \nWeek / Month \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 \n16 \n AP030 \nTrain Red Cross volunteers on water, sanitation and hygiene \nsituation assessment \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nAP030 \nSelect target groups, key messages and communication \nmethods \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAP030 \nDesign and print awareness-raising materials \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAP030 \nOrganise hygiene and sanitation awareness sessions \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nP a g e  | 18 \n \n \nInternal \n \n \nNeeds analysis: The duration of the crisis, and the time exposed to the lack of means to provide families with the basic needs, puts pressure on the heads of \nhouseholds, especially single-parent households or households with a high dependency ratio, and mainly those headed by women, people with disabilities and \nelderly people, with a greater workload or fewer resources to meet household needs. In view of this situation, the CRCV will assess these cases to prioritise them \nas a target group and include protection support activities, if necessary. RCCV will learn on the experience, training and support of its partners to ensure inclusive \nmeasures throughout the operation. \nThe RCCV will conduct protection activities through the training of volunteers in each target area.

Unfortunately, the negative impact keeps deteriorating causing more vulnerability. \nBased on this, SARC has decided to initiate a specific response to the drought situation and is seeking IFRC \nsupport in this regard using the DREF support as a start noting that SARC is also coordinating with other partners \nto ensure a scale response.  The number of people that are food insecure and in acute need of humanitarian \nassistance increased by 400,000 during the first half of 2021 bringing the total number to 12.8 million people, an \nincrease of more than 60% compared to 20211. According to the FAO,2 Syrian farmers face challenges preparing \nfor the upcoming planting season due to lack of liquidity and access to credit, while prices of inputs such as \nfertilizers and fuel are increasing.

This impacts in particular small-scale \nfarmers that lack alternative livelihoods income sources and continue to cultivate their lands.   \n \nA. Situation analysis \n \nDescription of the disaster  \nSince January 2021, Syria has witnessed unprecedented low water levels of the Euphrates River, falling from 500m3 \nto 214 m3 in June, resulting in two of the most significant reservoirs in Syria having significantly diminished and 54 \nout of 73 water stations severely impacted (OCHA, 2021)3 in Aleppo, Deir-ez-Zor, Al-Hasakeh, and Ar-Raqqa \ngovernorates. Low levels of water in reservoirs resulted in reduced energy production capacity causing power \nblackouts across north-eastern Syria, with only 1-2 hours of electricity in some locations and up to three million \npeople have been affected by reduced electricity generation and availability. Compounded by ongoing fuel \nshortages, water pumping stations have limited functionality, affecting safe access to and availability of drinking \nwater of the population in north-eastern Syria.  \n \nAt the same time, low and erratic rainfall during the 2020/2021 winter season, accompanied by higher-than-\naverage temperatures, led to drought conditions in Northern and North-East Syria, as well as in other parts of \nSyria, with significant crop and livestock production losses in the south and central Syria. The Syrian Minister of \nAgriculture stated that \u2018this year is the most dangerous in terms of drought in Syria since 19534. The combined \neffect of reduced water levels in the Euphrates river and drought conditions has impacted the food and nutrition \n \n3OCHA (2021) Syrian Arab Republic.

Significant shortages and high cost \nof agriculture inputs, including diesel fuel, have limited the ability to provide supplementary irrigation for \ncultivated crops. Particularly in the northeast, Al-Hasakeh as the breadbasket of the country, reduction in both \nrainfall and river water for irrigation are predicted to further cause substantial harvest loss, indicating a major \ndrop in barley production by 1.2 million tonnes, as low as in 2018. Al-Hasakeh, which together with parts of Ar-\nRaqqa, Aleppo, and Deir-ez-Zor Governorates, accounts for about 80 per cent of the country\u2019s annual wheat and \nbarley production, has been particularly badly affected. Estimations suggest that up to 75 per cent of total rain-\nfed crop yield losses in Al-Hasakeh Governorate, and up to 25 per cent of irrigated yields losses in northern and \nnortheast Syria (NES), have occurred. This is expected to have implications across all of Syria, including for food \nsecurity. Moreover, with poor yields and crop failures undermining revenues, farmers will struggle to obtain \nnecessary inputs for the sowing season in November, which will have an impact on the 2022 harvest season.  \nThis, in turn, has an impact on the livelihoods and food security of five million persons5 (OCHA, 2021). Across the \nregion, 60,150 agricultural landowners and their families, as well as 83,000 seasonal agricultural workers are \nimpacted, seventy per cent of whom are seasonal women workers- the main group affected by the poor \nagriculture sector performance.  \nFor livestock, the production of fodder crops has been adversely affected and pastures are not in good condition \ndue to the erratic climatic conditions. Herders are unable to access some locations in the Badia for natural \ngrazing of their animals (particularly sheep), as a result of the unstable security situation. This is expected to \nresult in destocking and animal prices have dropped by at least 20 - 30 per cent.  \n \nAs the drought-like conditions and economic crisis persist, the capacity of vulnerable farming households and \nsmall-scale livestock keepers to generate income and access to food continues to erode. Harmful coping \nmechanisms have increased with households taking on more debt, while debt payment already accounts for \n13 per cent of average household expenditure in Deir-ez-Zor (the highest figure country-wide). There is an \nincreased reliance on child labour and child marriage, impacting children\u2019s rights and increasing the risk of \ngender-based violence. Available data indicates that five per cent of children of IDP households work to support \nhousehold income, with rates more than three times higher for female-headed IDP households, and particularly \nin North-East Syria (NES). \n \nDue to the unavailability of clean water, households are increasingly consuming unsafe water, and with an \nincreasing number of water-borne diseases, the public health system faces additional strain, which is exacerbated \nby the COVID-19 situation. In NES, the number of acute diarrhoea cases increased by 25% between January and \nJune 2022 when compared to the same period in 2022. In addition, the latest assessments from August indicate \nthat more than a third of 8,728 screened children have either severe acute malnutrition or moderate acute \nmalnutrition (North-East Syria NGO, 2021). The reduction in safe and sufficient water is affecting hygiene and \nother preventative measures, such as handwashing which is critical to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Confirmed \nCOVID-19 cases have continued to increase over the last weeks, with more than 131,000 cases reported in Syria \nas of 10 October. However, this is thought to be a significant underestimation due to most cases being undetected \ngiven the lack of access to testing facilities and equipment.  \nThe lack of water and the drought situation contribute to the deterioration of living standards, coupled with \nincreasing costs of food, water, and basic goods due to the massive devaluation of the local currency whilst the \nincome and purchasing power of people are shrinking. The situation is particularly challenging for internally \ndisplaced and households returning to their areas of origin with a lack of very basic infrastructure including water \nand sanitation, health facilities, education, and electricity. There are an estimated 289,000 internally displaced \npersons in northern and north-eastern Syria (OCHA, 2021). \nThe aforementioned crises come on top of a situation where 13.4 million people in Syria are in need of immediate \nlife-saving and continuous humanitarian assistance, 2.34 million more than in 2020.

The assessment findings confirmed the need for immediate \nhumanitarian assistance in particular for returning internally displaced households triggered the launch of this \nEmergency Plan of Action. This plan targets areas and populations in need of immediate humanitarian assistance \nnot covered by the UN OCHA Water Crisis in Northern and Northeast Syria: Immediate Response Plan that \ncurrently is less than 25% funded. Lastly, the outlook for the upcoming agricultural season is dire with agriculture-\ndependent households unable to access inputs (seeds and fertilizers) due to increased prices and lack of capital. \nThe water scarcity and high prices of fuel make irrigation out of reach for many a household and the lack of \npasture and high price of feed for animals has resulted in the destocking of weaker animals.  \n \nSummary of the current response  \n \nOverview of Operating National Society Response Action \nHeadquartered in Damascus, the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) has a network of 14 branches across all the \ngovernorates of Syria and 73 active sub-branches manned by 8,031 active volunteers and 5,749 staff working \nacross its headquarters, branches, and sub-branches. \n \nSARC is well recognised by the authorities and is one of the key members of the Humanitarian and Disaster \nResponse Committees both at national as well as governorate levels. Through its network of staff and volunteers, \nand presence across most of the country, it remains the largest national provider of humanitarian services in Syria. \nSARC works closely with local communities providing humanitarian assistance to more than five million internally \ndisplaced people, affected host communities, and returnees per year.  \n \nIn the first half of 2021, SARC provided life-saving and life-sustaining health services to more than one million \npatients across a network of 150 health facilities both static and mobile-based. The National Society was also able \nto reach 80 per cent of the Syrian population with safe water through treatment and maintenance of damaged \nwater infrastructure, the expertise which will be leveraged for this drought response.  \n \nSARC\u2019s staff and volunteer sector specialists at HQ and in branches and sub-branches have been monitoring the \ndrought conditions throughout the recent months, observing the further deterioration of the situation over the \npast weeks, and are coordinating with the relevant local stakeholders for information sharing, response planning, \nand coordinated actions. SARC has a network of four active sub-branches in Deir-ez-Zor and Ar-Raqqa, the \ntargeted governorates for the water crises response (Debsi Afnan and Sabka in Ar-Raqqa; Al Mayadin and Abu \nKamal in Deir-ez-Zor) in addition to branch offices in the governorate capitals. A team of 710 staff and volunteers \nimplement multi-sectoral programmes and operations including food security (regular food distribution with \nWFP), relief, water and rehabilitation, livelihoods, community services, and risk education. The combined number \nof registered SARC beneficiaries in the two governorates exceeds 700,000.  SARC operates four health service \ncentres/points in Deir-ez-Zor: one primary health clinics, one Mobile Health Unit (MHU), one nutrition centre, and \none mobile physiotherapy team. 40 volunteers and 100 community health promoters are engaged in health risk \ncommunication, community engagement, and awareness-raising activities. SARC\u2019s WASH and rehabilitation \ndepartment reaches 80% of the total Syrian population annually with water treatment, maintenance, and \nrehabilitation work of water stations, pipeline, and sewage systems as well as water emergency response. In Deir-\nez-Zor and Ar-Raqqa, SARC implemented 41 different water and rehabilitation projects in 2020, representing 15% \nof all water projects across the country. Food security and livelihoods have also been one of SARC's priorities in \nAr- Raqqa and Deir-ez-Zor supporting the most vulnerable people through the distribution of food parcels and \ndifferent livelihood interventions such as seed, agro tools, and sheep distributions, installation of water pumps or \n \n6 OCHA (2021) Water Crisis in Northern and Northeast Syria: Immediate Response and Funding Requirements \nhttps://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/water-crisis-northern-and-northeast-syria-immediate-response-and-funding  \nP a g e  | 5 \n \n \n \n \nPublic \nPublic \nfood production projects. SARC\u2019s community services and risk education activities reached up to 30,000 people in \nDeir-ez-Zor in 2020. SARC has continued to provide the above-mentioned ongoing humanitarian assistance during \nthe build-up to the water crises and drought conditions. SARC branches have collected information on the \ncompound effects on the already vulnerable population in consultation and coordination with sub-national \ngovernment departments and authorities and analyzed secondary data to inform the response strategy.  \n \nOverview of Red Cross Red Crescent Movement Actions in-country  \nThe IFRC has been present in Syria supporting SARC in the implementation of its humanitarian work across the \ncountry since the mid-1990s and established a permanent representation office in 2007. Over the course of the \nlast two decades, the IFRC has provided technical support to SARC in implementing its programmes and supported \nSARC with its Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) mechanism to effectively respond to climate-related hazards \nsuch as droughts, floods, wildfires among others. \n \nThe ICRC supports technically and financially SARC\u2019s programmes and operations across Syria including in health, \nwater and habitat, economic security, IHL, and restoring family links. ICRC continues to support ongoing \noperations and programmes in the areas targeted by the DREF operation while together with SARC and the \nMovement components present in Syria continue to monitor the development of the situation.  \n \nCurrently, IFRC is building up Syria Crisis Country Plan for 2022 together with Movement components, with SARC \nat the helm, with the goal of ensuring the sustainability of its interventions and reaching all sections of the \npopulation, including vulnerable populations, and strengthening services delivered to communities affected by \nthe conflict, COVID-19 and the ongoing economic crisis. This DREF will support the lifesaving emergency response \nto water crises and drought whilst the Syria Crises Country Plan focuses on addressing vast and severe pre-existing \nhumanitarian needs in Syria and supporting national society development initiatives to SARC as the foremost \nhumanitarian organization in the country. \n \nOverview of other actors\u2019 actions in-country \nOn 9 September, UNOCHA issued an immediate response plan and funding requirements for the Water Crisis in \nNorthern and Northeast Syria- seeking to reach 3.4 million people by February 2022 with a total budget of USD \n251 million. The Syria Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) in which SARC, IFRC, and ICRC have observer status, the \nNortheast NGO Forum (NES Forum), with the Syria Cross-Border Humanitarian Liaison Group (HLG) have \ncoordinated the response planning and preparedness efforts, with support by the Whole of Syria Inter-Sector \nGroup (ISG). \n \nThere are several coordination mechanisms established in Syria, and in Northeast Syria, humanitarian \norganizations have an established presence in Ar-Raqqa, Aleppo, and Hassakeh Governorates. Assistance is \nprovided by UN Agencies, INGOs, NGOs, and local actors operating. Expanding operations further in Deir-ez-Zor \nhas proved more challenging, leading to the presence of fewer humanitarian actors, despite acute needs. \n \nSARC coordinates with INGOs and UN agencies as the main partner in carrying out humanitarian activities while \nmaintaining its mandate without compromising the basic principles of the International Red Cross and Red \nCrescent Movement. Furthermore, SARC is coordinating with the relevant authorities (government) through its \nrelevant channels in order to join efforts in the response to the water crises and drought.  \n \nNeeds analysis, targeting, scenario planning and risk assessment \n \nNeeds analysis  \nAccording to available needs assessment data, due to the water crisis and drought conditions compounded by \npre-existing crises, 5.5 million people have reduced access to safe and sufficient water with severe implications \nfor public health, 3.4 million are experiencing poor agricultural production and loss of livelihoods, leading to or \nP a g e  | 6 \n \n \n \n \nPublic \nPublic \nexacerbating food insecurity and increasing malnutrition rates, and 3 million people are affected by reduced \nelectricity generation and availability7. \nThe immediate needs for the next six months include8:  \n\u27a2 Ensure access to safe water for 3.44 million people through retrofitting and rehabilitating and provision \nof chlorine for water stations and tanker filling stations, water trucking, and water provision for health and \neducation facilities.  \n\u27a2 Provide immediate food assistance and livelihoods for 3.36 million people through the provision of food \nrations, crop seeds, livestock production support, and treatment for malnourished children and pregnant \nand lactating mothers.  \n\u27a2 Scale-up essential health services at hospitals and health centres, set up rapid response teams to support \nearly detection of water-borne diseases and acute malnutrition.  \n\u27a2 Carry out protection-related activities to mitigate protection risks including GBV, PSS, and child protection.    \n \nAccording to SARC data from Deir-ez-Zor, the drought conditions and low water level in the Euphrates river have \nhad a severe negative impact on the areas between the countryside of the Ma\u2019dan Atiq area bordering with Ar-\nRaqqa governorate to the city of Al-Bukamal, bordering with Iraq. This area is known for agriculture and livestock. \nIn total, it is estimated that 29,460 hectares under wheat cultivation have been damaged, with large areas of land \nfor other crops being taken out of the production process due to lack of water for irrigation (both rain and river-\nfed irrigation).  \nWhile the water crisis has impacted the entire governorate, the most affected areas in the southern part of Deir-\nez-Zor include the agricultural areas of Al-Ashara area, Subikhan Al-Gharbia, and Dublan. These areas are \ndependent on rain-fed agriculture for their livelihoods as a result of the effects of more than 10 years of crisis and \nthe destruction of irrigation stations. More than half of the population are internally displaced returnees.  \n \nThe following impact was reported by SARC branches in Ar-Raqqa and Deir-ez-Zor based on primary data \ncollection and analysis:  \n\u27a2 The wheat crop has been completely damaged, resulting in a decrease in the percentage of wheat supply \nand an increase in prices.  \n\u27a2 A large number of farmers refrained from cultivating cotton as a result of drought and the low level of \nrain.  \n\u27a2 Sesame cultivation areas have been damaged. Sesame is considered a lower-cost alternative to cotton \nand wheat in the targeted area under agriculture and many families in particular in Deir-ez-Zor rely on the \nstaple to make their living.  It requires less water, labour, and pesticides than cotton.   \n\u27a2 Livestock-dependent households, destocking large numbers of animals due to the combined effect from \nlack of pastures as a result of drought and lack of irrigation and high price of the allocated fodder. \n\u27a2 Increasing the number of families migrating out of the country or into urban areas as a result of the \nseverely worsened food security situation. \n\u27a2 The livelihoods and income for farmers have been impacted and have led to job loss in rural livelihoods. \n\u27a2 The income and purchasing power of people are shrinking. \n \nSARC branch teams report an increase in the prevalence of water-borne diseases due to water shortage including \nintestinal infections - fungal infections, and skin diseases. The affected rural areas in particular from Al-Mayadin \ntowards Al-Ashara and Subikhan suffer from a lack of medical services.  \n \n \n7 WATER CRISIS IN NORTHERN AND NORTHEAST SYRIA Immediate Response and Funding Requirements, 8 September 2021, \nUN OCHA.  \n8 Water Crisis in Northern and Northeast Syria - Immediate Response and Funding Requirements \u2013 9 September 2021.  \nhttps://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/water_crisis_response_plan-september_2021.pdf  \n \nP a g e  | 7 \n \n \n \n \nPublic \nPublic \nDeir-ez-Zor returnee households affected by drought9   \n \nArea \n# of returnee households most severely \naffected by the water crisis/drought  \n# \nof \nreturnee \nhouseholds  \nSbaykhan \n3,450 \n5,452 \nAl-Ashara \n2,000 \n2,777 \nGharibah \n1,500 \n1,765 \nDablan \n1,400 \n1,647 \nAl Dowayr \n1,300 \n1,355 \nAl \nKeshmah \n2,550 \n2,767 \nTotal \n12,200   \n15,763 \nTable 1:Most affected areas in Deir-ez-Zor \nBased on the information collected by SARC, Deir-ez-Zor governorate is more affected by Ar-Raqqa, and the \nimmediate needs that can be covered by the DREF are food and awareness-raising for health and hygiene. \nDistribution of food parcels10 will reduce negative comping strategies and ensure sufficient food intake.

Health and hygiene awareness is assumed to reduce the \nmorbidity of water-borne diseases and promote COVID-19 preventive measures.      \n \nTargeting  \nSARC intends to assist 15,000 of the most vulnerable people among those in need of humanitarian assistance as \na result of water crises and drought conditions (3,000 households). These are the households most severely \naffected by the drought and low water level in the Euphrates, as well as the consequences, and who have a high \nlevel of vulnerability and low coping capacity as a result of the compound effects from ten years of crises and \nCOVID-19. The households are currently part of SARC\u2019s regular food distribution programme receiving food \nparcels every four months to cover a portion of their basic food needs, but not enough to cover the entire food \ngap due to the impact of the drought. The final selection criteria will be refined during the detailed assessment, \ntargeting, and registration with the following criteria serving as guidance:  \n  \n\u2022 \nHouseholds directly affected by the water crisis and drought conditions. \n\u2022 \nHouseholds whose livelihoods and economic status have significantly deteriorated.  \n\u2022 \nInternally displaced returnee households.  \n \nThe geographical areas targeted by this operation include the most affected localities in the governorates of Ar-\nRaqqa and Deir-ez-Zor, where SARC has ongoing activities. In these areas, SARC has established branches and \nsub-branches with trained staff and volunteers in emergency relief operations as well as support staff.

Operational strategy \n \nOverall Operational objective:  \nThe overall objective of this DREF operation is to provide humanitarian assistance to 15,000 most vulnerable \npeople (3,000 households) affected by drought conditions in Ar-Raqqa and Deir-ez-Zor through the distribution of \nfood parcels and delivery of hygiene promotion messages and disease prevention awareness-raising for water-\nborne diseases and COVID-19 through SARC volunteers and community health promoters. This DREF operation \naddress new humanitarian needs caused by the drought conditions and it does not duplicate or overlap response \nunder the ongoing Syria Complex Emergency Appeal that will be closed in December 2021 or the 2021 Syria Crisis \nCountry Plan.   \nAn emergency plan of action has been developed based on analysis of primary and secondary data sources and \nSARC\u2019s in-depth knowledge about the conditions in the targeted areas through its network of staff and volunteers. \nThe following activities have been undertaken:  \n\u2022 \nCarrying out a primary needs assessment and multi-sector data collection by SARC\u2019s branches in Ar-Raqqa \nand Deir-ez-Zor \n\u2022 \nPerforming analysis of primary and secondary data sources.  \n\u2022 \nDeveloping an emergency plan of action to meet the immediate humanitarian needs over the next six \nmonths.  \n\u2022 \nInitiating a multi-sectoral planning process for a longer-term response that combines immediate life-\nsaving humanitarian assistance with early recovery to support a more sustainable solution that builds the \nresilience of the population to drought conditions.    \n \nThe response strategy for the immediate phase (six months) focuses on food security, hygiene promotion, and \nhealth awareness-raising as well as the conduct of a detailed multi-sector impact and needs assessment to inform \nthe response strategy for the subsequent phase covering a multi-sectoral and holistic approach integrating food \nsecurity, health and WASH. Response sectors and geographical areas may be changed or expanded in a possible \nscaled-up response based on detailed needs assessments and the development of the drought conditions over \nthe next months.  \nThis operation will complement the ongoing and regular food distributions undertaken by SARC in the drought-\naffected areas by meeting new and additional needs that surpass the scale of the regular distributions. As this is \nP a g e  | 10 \n \n \n \n \nPublic \nPublic \nan expansion of an ongoing humanitarian response operation in the area, food parcels will be distributed instead \nof cash and voucher assistance which would introduce a new modality to only a portion of the population covered \nby the regular distributions in the same affected communities. The areas covered by this operation are also \nremote and sparsely populated with long distances to market and financial service providers. The approach \nfollows that of the inter-agency immediate resource plan which seeks to provide four-month protection food \nrations to vulnerable farming and food-insecure households while ensuring coordinated targeting and delivery of \nservices with different actors.  \nDuring the timeframe of the DREF operation, a detailed multi-sectoral needs assessment, taking into account \ngender and diversity aspects will be undertaken by specialized teams of SARC staff and volunteers to cover relief, \nwater, food security, protection, and health needs. The methodologies for the assessment ensure community \nparticipation and include household interviews, Key Informant Interviews with communities, observation, and \ncollection and analysis of secondary data from relevant local government departments and institutions.  \n \nHuman resources  \nIn all of Syria, SARC has a network of 13,780 staff and trained and active volunteers. In Ar-Raqqa and Deir-ez-Zor \n710 staff and volunteers are involved in delivering a large range of multi-sectoral services to those most in need. \nBased on need, additional staff and volunteers can be deployed for the implementation of the operation from \nother branches and sub-branches. The DM department at SARC\u2019s HQ has the overall responsibility for the timely \nand quality implementation of the operation in coordination with other sectoral departments including \nlivelihoods, health and water, and rehabilitation. The Partnerships and Performance Support Department (PPSD) \nwill be responsible for supporting inter-departmental coordination and reporting and data collection and analysis \ntogether with the other departments The IFRC Syria country delegation will support SARC in the monitoring and \nreporting of the operation with the IFRC MENA regional office based in Beirut providing technical inputs and \nsupport. A rapid response deployment will support the operational aspects together with SARC HQ.  \nLogistics and supply chain  \nLogistic support to the intervention will be provided following IFRC procedures to ensure efficient and timely \nprovision to affected people. IFRC\u2019s in-country Procurement Delegate and IFRC\u2019s MENA regional office will support \nSARC with the local procurement of items required for the operation.  \nCommunications  \nPublic communication content will be produced and published on IFRC MENA social media platforms and IFRC.org. \nIn collaboration with SARC, testimonies of people who have benefitted from the grants will be collected and \npublished.   Information on the operation will be disseminated in coordination with the IFRC and Movement \npartners to highlight the response to the humanitarian needs and the evolving and emerging humanitarian \nconcerns. IFRC in the country and MENA region will provide support to SARC to produce updates for different \nmedia channels on the implementation of the operation. Information will also be shared via the IFRC Go Platform.  \nCommunity Engagement and Accountability (CEA)  \nCEA is integrated throughout the intervention to ensure maximum and meaningful participation of affected \ncommunities. SARC has been strengthening its capacity in CEA through community-based programmes in 2021. \nCEA was first addressed within the needs assessment where community perspectives around their needs were \ncaptured and utilized to support the design of this appeal. Additionally, SARC has established feedback \nmechanisms through activating a hotline to allow two-way communication and ensure accountability of the \noperation by addressing potential complaints/feedback from the target households and non-target communities. \nSARC will be also collecting community feedback throughout the satisfaction surveys and regular monitoring \nactivities. Moreover, the key community stakeholders and leaders will be engaged in all community level \ndistributions to ensure the ownership of the community.   Learnings from previous operations including the \nresponse to 2020 wildfires will also be applied in the CEA mechanisms for this operation.  \n \nP a g e  | 11 \n \n \n \n \nPublic \nPublic \nSafety and Security \nTo undertake the planned activities, SARC will coordinate with the Movement partners and evaluate the evolving \nsecurity situation. Access challenges may occur due to the sporadic presence of Islamic State across the M20 road, \nparticularly around As Sukhnah. The IFRC Country Delegation and Regional Security Coordinator will provide \nsupport as needed, in supplement to that which is provided by Movement Partners. Personal protection \nequipment (PPEs) for volunteers\u2019 safety will be provided for COVID-19 infection prevention and control. \nPlanning, Monitoring, Evaluation, and Reporting (PMER)/ Information Management (IM) \nSARC HQ will be monitoring and supporting the implementation of the operation undertaken by the branches and \nsub-branches. Data collection and information communication procedures will be put in place to measure \nprogress against the set indicator targets for the intervention. This process will also inform the development of a \npossible emergency appeal. The monitoring process will be as a following:  \n\u2022 \nMonthly progress reports are prepared by implementing branches and sub-branches.  \n\u2022 \nRegular \u2018task-force\u2019 meetings.  \n\u2022 \nField visits and monitoring from SARC HQ.  \n\u2022 \nHotlines: dedicated staff and volunteers will manage hotline calls according to established procedures. \nData will be collected on the type and number of calls and how they have been responded to.  \n\u2022 \nRegular budget vs expenditure follow-up and budget modifications if required. \n\u2022 \nAn end-of-operation lessons learned workshop will be organized by IFRC and SARC to reflect on the DREF \nimplementation and to take stock of that for future responses and to inform response preparedness \nplanning efforts. \n \nTechnical PMER capacity and technical support will be provided through the IFRC MENA Regional Delegation PMER \nteam. This will help identify and, where possible and necessary, resolve any issues. An end-of-operation lessons \nlearned exercise will take place to capture the relevance, efficiency, and effectiveness of the operation. It will also \nbe used to measure qualitative outcome indicators and to ensure that the best practices are captured to inform \nthe planning and designing of the long-term projects towards improved ways of working and increasing \neffectiveness and efficiency to the communities. The IFRC MENA regional IM will be supporting the Syria Country \nDelegation as well as SARC in reporting through the IFRC GO platform to share updated field reports, information \nbulletins, documents, and updates to the emergency page on GO. \n \nAdministration and Finance  \nSARC will be responsible for managing the funds in accordance with standards procedures for IFRC working \nadvance transfers. The IFRC through the country office and finance department in MENA regional office will \nprovide necessary operational support for review, validation of budgets, bank transfers, and technical assistance \nto the SARC on procedures for justification of expenditures, including the review and validation of invoices and \nreceipts.  \nP a g e  | 12 \n \n \n \n \n \nPublic \nPublic \nC. Detailed Operational Plan \n \n \nLivelihoods and basic needs \nPeople targeted: 10,000 (2,000 HHs) \nMale: 4,875 \nFemale: 5,125 \nRequirements (CHF): 586,023 \nNeeds analysis:  \nIn this sector and based on the assessment and data collection undertaken by SARC, the immediate need among the target population is food assistance. Due to the \nfailure of the winter rains in 2020/2021 and the extremely low water level in the Euphrates river, large areas of land under rain-fed agriculture have been affected \nand will yield lower than normal harvests. This has negatively impacted the availability of food and income for households that are completely reliant on agriculture. \nIn addition, negative coping mechanisms are on the rise, including destocking of animals due to a lack of fodder for the most affected households, a lack of pasture, \nand market-high fodder prices. There have also been reports of households moving into urban areas in search of livelihoods or migrating to other countries via \nunsafe routes.  \n \nDue to the remoteness of the targeted areas and lack of financial services at the immediate stage of the operation, food parcels will be provided instead of multi-\npurpose unconditional cash grants. The multi-sectoral assessment will consider the feasibility of cash and voucher assistance.  \n \nRisk analysis: The drought emergency intensifies, and communities are taking negative coping strategies. Malnutrition and health problems will worsen if families \ndo not receive food assistance. The population in the target area relies mostly on the natural resource base to meet daily needs (livestock and small-scale farming), \nbut serious environmental issues such as desertification, climate change, aquifer depletion, ecosystem degradation, biodiversity loss, and pollution all negatively \nimpact the resilience of the rural livelihoods. \n \nPopulation to be assisted: Food assistance will be provided to 2,000 households through food parcels estimated to cover the food intake of a family of five persons \nfor one month. The food parcels will be distributed to the households two times during the operation. The communities will be consulted and informed of the \nselection criteria and how they can contact SARC. The beneficiaries will also be consulted during the post-distribution monitoring and during the detailed needs \nassessment conducted during the timeframe of the DREF operation.  \n\u2022 \nHouseholds are directly affected by the water crisis and drought conditions. \n\u2022 \nHouseholds whose livelihoods and economic status have significantly deteriorated.  \n\u2022 \nInternally displaced returnee households.  \n\u2022 \nWomen-headed households, widows, divorcees, separated, single parents with no income. \n\u2022 \nHouseholds with people with disabilities. \nP a g e  | 13 \n \n \n \n \n \nPublic \nPublic \n\u2022 \nHouseholds with multiple children. \n \nThe beneficiary targeting will be undertaken by SARC staff and volunteers familiar with the areas and in coordination with the local authorities and other organizations \nworking in the areas.

SARC\u2019s \ninitial assessment reports an increase in the prevalence of water-borne diseases due to water shortage and quality of water including intestinal infections - fungal \ninfections, and skin diseases. The affected rural areas in particular from Al-Mayadin towards Al-Ashara and Subikhan suffer from a lack of medical services. The health \nfacility infrastructure has been severely affected by the 10 years of crisis and the lack of access to medical services is challenging in the rural remote areas. The impact \nfrom the COVID-19 has put an additional burden on the already weak health system. COVID-19 reported cases have been on the increase in the entire country in recent \nweeks including in the areas affected by the drought.  \n \nP a g e  | 14 \n \n \n \n \n \nPublic \nPublic \nSARC's priority will be to provide health education to the people in the target communities through Community Based Health and First Aid volunteers (CBHFA) and \ncommunity health promoters. The existing Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) materials will be adapted to provide culturally appropriate and \nstandardised messages to the affected communities on health, hygiene and COVID-19. SARC\u2019s volunteers and health promoters are trusted sources of information that \ncan engage in two-way communication and dialogue with the communities allowing dispelling misinformation and debunking myths.  Context-specific COVID-19 \nmessages addressing misperceptions and vaccine hesitancy will form a part of all awareness-raising activities.   \n \nPopulation to be assisted: A total of 5,000 people will be targeted by health interventions.  \n \nProgramme standards/benchmarks: SARC will coordinate and harmonize the health interventions with humanitarian actors.

Situation Analysis  \n \nDescription of the disaster  \n \nSince 2017, the country has been facing one of the worst drought crises ever since the 1990s. Rains continue to be \nrare, and production does not even cover 1% of the country's food needs. The majority of the Cape Verdean population \nlives from agriculture (22% of the active population is employed by the agricultural sector, of which 82% is in rural \nareas). This situation leads 24.2% of the population to live in poverty and 9.2% in extreme poverty. \n \nEmergency Action Plan (EPoA) \nCape Verde: Drought  \n \nP a g e  | 2 \n \n \nInternal \n \nFarmers find it more and more difficult to continue their productive \nactivities. After more than four seasons of considerable rainfall deficit, \nagricultural productivity yields have deteriorated considerably and \naquifers did not recharge, which affects access to water for the \npopulation and their livelihood activities. \n \nThe 2021-2022 agro pastoral campaign was characterized by a late \nstart and an early end to the rains, throughout the national territory. \nOverall agricultural production varies from low to nil, depending on \nthe agro-climatic strata of the municipalities. Cereal production is \nestimated at 640 tons of maize, recording an 80% decrease, \ncompared to the average of the last 5 years. As for bean production, \nit has fallen by 90% compared to the average of the last 5 years, and \nstands at 197 tons.1 \n \nAs a result, the Government of Cape Verde has declared, on 16 \nFebruary 2022, the situation of national drought emergency \ndisaster. This was contrary to the forecasts of the Agrhymet Center \nwhich predicted a campaign with a rainfall varying from normal to \nexcess and a regular to early start for the Sahel region. \n \nAt the national level, production of fodder has been regular to low, \nand data show that the situation is normal in the southern islands and \nweak in the northern islands, where the most critical situation is in the \nmunicipality of Porto Novo, on the island of Santo Ant\u00e3o. The \nphytosanitary situation was characterized by the strong and localized \nattack of the \u201cOedaleus Senegalensis\u201d locust on the islands of \nSantiago, Maio, Fogo and Brava. There was also a widespread attack \nof the \"green bug\" on maize and bean crops. \n \nGiven the adverse conditions linked to the agro-pastoral agricultural campaign, some municipalities in the country are \nin a situation of acute food insecurity. The results of the Harmonized Framework (March 2022), presented as part of \nthe Regional Food Crisis Prevention and Management System (PREGEC) held 28 - 30 March 2022 show a current \nsituation of food insecurity affecting 29,421 people in the phase of crisis (Ph 3), and 1,076 people in the \nemergency phase (Ph 4), mainly on the island of Santiago (in the municipality of Ribera Grande, which was the only \none recorded in phase 3), and a projected situation for this year's lean period (June to August 2022) of 46,093 \npeople in food insecurity (10% of the population) including 43,003 in crisis (Ph 3) and 3,090 in the emergency \nphase (Ph 4)2. \n \nFrom June to August 2022, 4 municipalities will be in phase 3 (crisis), namely: Porto Novo on the island of Santo Ant\u00e3o, \nand Sao Domingos, Santa Cruz and Ribeira Grande on the island of Santiago. Considering the current situation and \nthe anticipated situation, it is important to start a number of response and preparedness actions while putting in place \nanticipatory measures to limit the impact of the projected drought and reduce the vulnerability of the most vulnerable \npopulations at risks mentioned above. \n \n1 Source: Presentation - Harmonized Framework for Analysis and Identification of Areas at Risk and Estimation of Food Insecure Populations in Cabo Verde, \nPraia, March 7-11, 2022 \n2 Source: Communication sheet CH de Cabo Verde \"Harmonized framework for identifying areas and estimating populations in acute food and nutrition insecurity \nin Cabo Verde - Current situation (March-April-May 2022) and projected (June- July-August 2022)\", March 2022 \n \nImage : Bulletin Officiel de la R\u00e9publique du \nCap Vert (16 f\u00e9vrier 2022) \n \nP a g e  | 3 \n \n \nInternal \nPhasing \nZones \nPopulation \nPopulation (%) \nCurrent \nProjected \nCurrent \nProjected \nCurrent \nProjected \nPh1 \n4 \n2 \n346,464 \n299,473 \n72 \n62 \nPh2 \n17 \n16 \n106,666 \n138,062 \n22 \n29 \nPh3 \n1 \n4 \n29,421 \n4,3003 \n6 \n9 \nPh4 \n0 \n0 \n1,076 \n3,090 \n0,2 \n1 \nPh5 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0,0 \n0 \nTotal \n22 \n22 \n483,627 \n483,628 \n100 \n100 \n \nSource: Analysis of the harmonized framework - March 2022. Results of the analysis of the harmonized framework \u00e9 \n(March 2022) on the current situation and the projected situation (June to August 2022). \n \nSummary of the current intervention  \n \nOverview of Host National Society action \n \nThe Red Cross Society of Cape Verde (RCSCV), through its local branches and in close collaboration and cooperation \nwith the decentralized structures of the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment and the municipal coordination bodies \nof the areas, participates in the various coordination meetings set up by the Cape Verdean government, including the \nworkshops of the harmonized framework at national level. \n \nRCCV has experience in the implementation of DREF operations3 and in food security and nutrition. The National \nSociety (NS) teams have both theoretical and practical skills in the area of food security and livelihoods (SAME), thanks \nto an in-depth assessment carried out in 2018 on the islands of Santiago and Santo Ant\u00e3o. This evaluation mobilized \nseveral volunteers and staff from RCCV and counted on the support of two staff sent by the Livelihood Center (CME) \nhosted by the Spanish Red Cross. \n \nDuring the COVID 19 pandemic, RCCV mobilized more than 300 volunteers to provide food assistance to vulnerable \npeople who were in lockdown. \n \nThe NS team is composed of one ERU WASH and FACT, 7 RDRT members, 60 NDRT members and more than 450 \nCommunity Disaster Response Team (CDRT) members of all backgrounds. As part of this operation, it is planned  to \nmobilize around 250 volunteers, including 3 in general coordination, a volunteer specialist in food security and \nlivelihoods (SAME), and all the support services (finance and logistics) of the Secretariat. Field activities will be carried \nout on different fronts in accordance with the main lines of action defined in the operational strategy. \n \nRCCV actively participates in Sahel+ initiatives, including the Migration and SAME technical groups. During the last \ngeneral assembly of the Sahel+, held in March 2022 in The Gambia, the RCCV were chairing the network. \n \nOverview of the action of the RCRC Movement in the country \n \nThere is no representation of the Red Cross Movement in Cape Verde. The RCCV receives technical and financial \nsupport from Partner National Societies (PNS - Spanish, Luxembourg, and Canadian Red Cross Societies), from ICRC \nand from the Federation. The IFRC will ensure regular support is provided to the NS to respond to this disaster and \nregular coordination will be put in place. The Spanish Red Cross has funded various projects in the field of food \nsecurity, in particular between 1997 and 2000. Following the drought situation and the 2017 \u2013 2018 poor agricultural \nseasons, the Spanish Red Cross assisted the NS in carrying out field assessments and analysing the data collected. \nThe Luxembourg and Canadian Red Cross Societies, provided support in the fight against COVID-19 and disaster \npreparedness and response, etc. \n \nA cash and voucher assistance specialist from the Burkinabe Red Cross will be mobilized through the British Red \nCross' Cash School to build the team\u2019s capacities in the area and support the contracting process with the Financial \nServices Provider. \n \nThe NS also receives funding from the UK government (Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office-FCDO), \nthrough the Risk-Based Early Action Partnership (REAP) whose Secretariat is hosted by the IFRC. This project, with \n \n3 In 2014, Operation DREF Fogo Volcano of CHF 119,069, targeting 2,500 people; and in 2009, Operation DREF Dengue Outbreak of CHF 153,951, targeting 75,000 \npeople. \nP a g e  | 4 \n \n \nInternal \nthe technical support of the IFRC, falls within the framework of REAP target 1, \"50 countries can review and integrate \ntheir laws, policies and/or crisis/disaster risk management plans and climate adaptation, to ensure that they reduce \nthe impacts of climate change and the exposure of people and the environment\".  \n \nThe specific objectives of the project are to: \ni) \nDevelop the capacities of key stakeholders, operating at the junction of disasters and climate; \nii) \nSupport the development of national regulatory frameworks for disaster risk management adapted to \nclimate change, which responds to the needs of the most vulnerable and involves local communities; \niii) \nShare best practices and promote recommendations to develop more coherent legal and policy \nframeworks for disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA). \n \nOverview of external Red Cross/Red Crescent actors in the country \n \nFor this emergency, the Cape Verdean Government has opted for the approval and implementation of an \"Emergency \nprogramme for the mitigation of the drought and the poor 2021/2022 agricultural Year \" (Resolution No. 13 /2022 of 16 \nFebruary, 2022) based on 3 major groups of measures to be implemented: \n\u2022 \nLivestock rescue: protect the breeding activity and ensure the conditions for the maintenance of ruminant \nbreeding. \n\u2022 \nManagement of water shortage: addressing the problem of water shortage by ensuring rational use and \nregularity of supply for households and agricultural and livestock holdings. \n\u2022 \nJob creation for affected families: protection of livelihoods with special attention to the most vulnerable \nfamilies (women and young people). \n \nThe Government of Cape Verde also benefits from the technical support of NGOs and UN agencies such as Action \nagainst Hunger (ACF), OXFAM and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and financial \nsupport from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the French Development Agency (AFD) \nand the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). \n \nNeeds analysis, beneficiary selection, scenario planning and risk assessment \n \nAnalysis of the Needs  \n \nCape Verde is an archipelago of ten islands \nand thirteen islets, located approximately 450 \nkm from Senegal.  It has an area of 4,033 \nkm2 and an exclusive economic zone \nestimated at 700,000 km2. Natural resources \nare scarce, the vast majority of soils are poor \nin organic matter and only 10% of land is \npotentially arable. Since its independence in \n1975, Cape Verde has been resolutely \ncommitted to the fight against desertification \nand the effects of drought. \n \nRainfall is generally low throughout the \ncountry, not exceeding 300 mm annual \naverage for 65% of the territory located at \nless than 400 m altitude. The areas under the \ninfluence of the trade winds being even drier \n(150 mm annual average). On the slopes \nlocated at more than 500 m of altitude facing \nthe trade winds, it can reach or exceed 700 \nmillimetres. \n \nSince 2017, the rainy seasons have been \nmore and more irregular and insufficient, and has impacted the availability of water and agricultural yield (agriculture \nand livestock) which have been considerably reduced as indicated by the declaration of the situation of national \ndisaster announced by the Government on 16 February, 2022. \n \nSource: Cape Verde Harmonised Framework Communication Sheet - \nProjected situation from June to August 2022 \nHarmonised Framework: analysis of acute food and nutrition insecurity \nprojected situation; June-July-August 2022 \nP a g e  | 5 \n \n \nInternal \nAccording to the Government4, given the results of the Harmonized Framework of March 2022, the number of people \nestimated to be in severe food insecurity (phases 3, 4) for the lean season (between June and August 22) amounts \nto 46,093 people, i.e., 9,218 households (10% of the population), including 43,003 in crisis (Ph 3) and 3,090 in \nemergency phase (Ph 4). \n \nThe areas most affected by this food insecurity, for the projected period, are the localities of Porto Novo (in Santo \nAnt\u00e3o), Santa Cruz, Ribeira Grande and Sao Domingo (in the island of Santiago). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe number of people (and households) at risk of food insecurity (Ph 2), is quite high, 138,062 people, or 27,612 \nhouseholds (29% of the population). \nThese figures refer to vulnerable populations affected by the climate shock (drought) and the COVID-19 \npandemic. To prevent the situation of affected population that are already under pressure/stress from worsening and \nmoving into phase 3 (crisis), the food insecurity of these populations must be monitored5.  \n \nLivelihoods and basic needs \nThe drought is compromising the food, nutritional, and economic security of households in these areas, jeopardizing \ntheir ability to meet their basic needs in the coming months and to invest in their livelihoods to ensure the continuity of \nthe agricultural season (after one \u201cfailed\u201dbad season, 2021-2022).  \nFood insecurity and malnutrition are likely to affect mainly small-scale farmers who have not recorded any production \ndue to the low diversification of their household economy, with a focus on female-headed households. \nFollowing the recommendations set out in the analysis of the Harmonized Framework6 for mitigating food insecurity \nforecasts and depletion of productive assets, in the short term, the priority needs of affected households are as follows: \n\u2022 \nCovering food needs during the peak of the lean season (June to September) to avoid depletion of assets and \nproductive assets; \n\u2022 \nThe provision of feed for animals (remaining herds of small ruminants) and support for destocking by slaughter; \n\u2022 \nThe need for assistance to help secure the livelihoods (agriculture and livestock) of the most vulnerable \npopulations during the next agricultural season. \n \nThe country has been experiencing several factors over the past three years that have disrupted the local market and \ncreated inflation in certain goods and services. In particular, the low agricultural production observed in recent years, \nthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the crisis in Ukraine have affected the markets for imported products, as is \nthe case for Cape Verde. The level of supply of agricultural products to the markets is generally more or less normal \nand regular.

The negative effects of malnutrition are \nparticularly felt among children aged 0-59 months) and pregnant or lactating women. \n \nFood insecurity is a major contributing factor to acute malnutrition, combined with inadequate food intake, low dietary \ndiversity among children and women, and a high prevalence of diseases (diarrhea, ARI, and malaria) linked to limited \naccess to water and health services. The COVID-19 epidemic was also an unusual shock, exacerbating malnutrition. \n \nWater, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) \n \nThe targeted communities face the problems of water scarcity, deterioration of existing water sources and dry \nagricultural land. They do not have access to good quality drinking water for their own consumption and for livestock \nand agriculture. Many people have to travel for many kilometres to find water for drinking or use tankers to irrigate their \nfields and give water to their livestock. Given the cost of water, many prefer to sell their livestock. It is therefore crucial \nto ensure that existing water points, which are already inadequate, are protected. \n \nProtection, gender and inclusion (PGI) \n \nThe duration of the crisis, and the time of exposure to the lack of means to provide families with basic needs, puts \npressure on heads of households, especially in the case of single-parent households or households with a high \ndependency ratio, and mainly those headed by women, disabled and elderly persons, with a greater workload or fewer \nresources to meet household needs. \n \nCommunity Engagement and Accountability (CEA) \n \nAffected populations should be consulted and involved in the needs assessment, the identification of response options, \nwhile we consider their perception on how these options match their needs. The first step is to identify the best \ncommunication channels to effectively inform communities and individuals about the targets and objectives of the \nhumanitarian assistance. The best way to collaborate with affected communities must then be determined according \nto the context and the feedback received. \n \nTargeting  \n \nThe RCCV will concentrate the humanitarian assistance in Ribeira Grande de Santiago, on the island of Santiago, and \nin Porto Novo, on the island of Santo Ant\u00e3o, as these two localities are the most affected (now and later on in June to \nAugust based on projections) by the drought and present a major risk of food insecurity cases in crisis and emergency. \nIt is projected that in these two locations, 6,026 people (1,205 households) would be severely food insecure between \nJune and August 2022, either in crisis (4,448 people) or emergency (1,578 people).  \n \nThe proposed targeting by intervention sector is as follows: \n \nSector \n \nActivities \nTarget \nLivelihoods and basic \nneeds  \nResponse actions \nFood assistance (cash transfers) \n400 households (2,000 \npeople \nAnticipated actions \nSupport to farmers (cash transfers \nfor purchase of seeds and fertilizer) \n100 households (500 \npeople) \n \nAnticipated actions \nSupport to livestock farmers (cash \ntransfers) for the purchase of feed \nand support for animal vaccination \n100 households (500 \npeople) \n \nResponse actions \nSupport for destocking through \nslaughter \n50 households (250 people) \n \nResponse/ preparation \n \nAwareness sessions for farmers and \nherders \n500 people \n \nHealth \nResponse/ preparation \n \nMalnutrition screening campaigns \n1,000 people \n \nResponse/ preparation \n \n \nDistribution of nutritional \nsupplements for a period of \nthree months \n200 people (children from 6 \nto 59 months and/or \npregnant and lactating \nwomen) \nP a g e  | 7 \n \n \nInternal \n \nResponse/ preparation \n \nAwareness sessions and cooking \ndemonstrations \n500 people \nWater, sanitation and \nhygiene (WASH) \nAnticipated actions \nRepair and maintenance of tanks, \nwells and/or boreholes in identified \nlocalities \n6,026 people \nAnticipated and response \nactions \nDistribution of buckets and jerry \ncans \n500 households (2,500 \npeople) \n \nAnticipated and response \nactions \nHygiene promotion and awareness \nactivities \n500 households (2,500 \npeople) \n \nProtection, gender \nand inclusion (PGI) \nResponse/ preparation \n \nCross-cutting actions for the entire \ntarget population \n6,026 people \nCommunity \nEngagement and \nAccountability (CEA) \nResponse/ preparation \n \nImplementation of the community \nfeedback mechanism \n6,026 people \n \nFurther evaluation during the implementation of this DREF will allow to adjust the number of people targeted, if \nnecessary by municipality, and provide disaggregated data.

There are \nno product shortages. According to the Agence de \nR\u00e9gulation des Produits Pharmaceutiques et \nAlimentaires (ARFA), grain availability is estimated \nat approximately 5,419.50 tons \nThe government has declared a \nstate of emergency throughout the \ncountry. \n \nThe RCCV responds to the most \nurgent needs through the \nimplementation of anticipatory \nactions in the face of the impending \ncrisis, through a DREF operation. \n \nThe RCCV continues to monitor the \nsituation, coordinating with partners \nin food safety groups and \nauthorities. \n \nRCCV develops a medium-to-long-\nterm food security and livelihoods \naction plan to address recurring \ndrought conditions. \nScenario 2 \n \nThe effects of the \ndrought are \nsomewhat greater \nthan predicted in the \nHarmonized \nFramework and the \nsituation deteriorates \ndespite the \nanticipatory actions \nput in place.  \n \n \n \nDeterioration of the food intake and nutritional \nstatus of the population, particularly for children \nunder five, with very likely negative consequences \non their health. \n \nSignificant loss of households livelihoods. \n \nDeterioration of livelihood protection and recovery \nwhich will not allow households to recover for the \nnext agricultural season. \n \nWASH situation deteriorates due to insufficient or \nlack of water. \n \nIncrease in market prices of foodstuffs. \n \nWomen, in particular, are caught in an endless cycle \nof debt. \n \nThe government is intensifying its \nactions nationwide.  \n \nThe RCCV updates and revises the \nDREF operation to respond to the \nincreased needs of the population. \n \nIFRC provides increased support to \nRCCV through the Dakar \ndelegation, including the \ndeployment of a Food Security and \nLivelihoods delegate. \n \nP a g e  | 8 \n \n \nInternal \nThe resilience of vulnerable households at national \nlevel is deteriorating. \nScenario 3 \n \nThe negative \neffects of the \ndrought far exceed \nthe predictions of \nthe Harmonized \nFramework and the \nsituation reaches a \ncatastrophic level  \nThere are several deaths in the country due to \nextreme famine. \n \nDrastic increase in cases of malnutrition. \n \nDisplacement of population. \n \nThe government renews its request \nfor assistance from UN agencies \nand international regional NGOs. \n \nRequest for the launch of an \nEmergency Appeal by the RCCV \nand activation of the IFRC's global \ntools. \n \n \nThe following factors will be assessed on an ongoing basis so that response options can be adapted as the situation \nchanges: \n \n\u2022 \nRainfall level; \n\u2022 \nLevel of increase in the market price of foodstuffs; \n\u2022 \nLevel of indebtedness of the population; \n\u2022 \nNumber of livestock deaths; \n\u2022 \nNumber of cases of malnutrition recorded; \n\u2022 \nNumber of displaced persons to less vulnerable communities; \n\u2022 \nNumber of deaths due to famine. \n \nAssessment of the risks associated with the operation  \nRisk \n \nControl \nThe lack of qualified human resources in the affected \nareas to meet the increased needs. \n  \nRCCV will mobilize more volunteers in the affected \nbranches and organize additional training sessions to \nsupport this operation. \nDrought conditions will continue throughout the year \nand the situation may worsen in the targeted \ncommunities even during the rainy season. \nRCCV through its branches and partners continues to \nmonitor the situation and provide assistance to the most \nvulnerable as best it can. RCCV is also developing a \nmedium-to-long-term food security and livelihoods \naction plan to better address the recurrence of drought \nconditions. \n \nDelays in the availability of funds for the distribution of \ncash transfers and other assistance items to \nbeneficiaries have a negative impact on the timely \ndelivery of humanitarian aid. \n \nThe RCCV commits its own emergency funds to start \nthe operation immediately after the DREF is launched. \nIn the event of a significant delay in the timeliness of \nfunds, an extension of time may be requested. \nThe lack of a framework agreement between a financial \nservice provider and the NS slows the implementation \nof the cash transfer programme and causes delays in \nthe distribution of humanitarian assistance to \nbeneficiaries. \n \n \n \nSupport from the British Red Cross Cash School is \nbeing provided through the deployment of a Cash and \nVoucher Assistance Specialist to Cape Verde for a \nperiod of six weeks beginning April 21, 2022. This \nsupport facilitates and accelerates the identification of a \nfinancial service provider that meets the needs of the \noperation and the IFRC's implementation standards. \nDespite the significant decrease in COVID cases in \nCape Verde, the risk of contracting the disease still \nexists and the lack of personal protective equipment \n(PPE) for staff and volunteers increases the risk of \nbeing infected during the community-based activities of \nthe response, resulting in a reduction in RCCV's \noperational capacity at the branch and sub-branch \nlevels.  \nThe RCCV will provide trainings for its staff and \nvolunteers. These trainings will take place in small \ngroups, respecting social distancing measures. \nDistribution exercises will ensure that physical \ndistancing standards are met. \n \nMarket volatility, prices and the impact of the COVID-19 \ncontext and the crisis in Ukraine on basic commodities \nand on WASH materials and agricultural inputs.  \n \n \nA market assessment in the first two weeks of the \noperation is planned, and ongoing market and price \nmonitoring to ensure that activities remain relevant, and \nallocations are sufficient to meet needs. \nP a g e  | 9 \n \n \nInternal \nB. Strategy of the operation \n \nOverall objective \n \nThe overall objective of this appeal is to respond to the immediate needs of the population affected by the \ncurrent drought and reduce their vulnerability to severe food insecurity and malnutrition in the coming \nmonths. This will be done in the localities of Ribeira Grande de Santiago, on the island of Santiago, and \nPorto Novo, on the island of Santo Ant\u00e3o, by providing immediate food assistance, implementing livelihood \npreparedness and protection activities, deploying actions to prevent malnutrition, ensuring better access to \nwater, and raising awareness on hygiene and sanitation issues. \n \nPlanned activities will also allow strengthening RCCV's disaster preparedness and response capacity in the \nareas of food security and cash transfers, and strengthen its national volunteers\u2019 network.  \n \nThis DREF operation aims at implementing and anticipating response activities to an impending crisis. The approach \ndeployed is as follows: \n1) Respond to the urgent needs of the most vulnerable populations and those most at risk of food insecurity \nduring the 2022 lean season (June to August 2022). This will be done through the implementation of \nanticipatory actions in water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), protection and strengthening of livelihoods in \nthe medium term (livestock, crops). \n2) Immediate livelihoods assistance response actions in terms of food and basic needs, and health.  \n \nOperational Strategy \n \nThrough this operation, RCCV aims to prevent and mitigate the consequences of the drought and the poor agricultural \nyears impacting the food and nutrition security situation and the protection of the livelihoods of the most vulnerable \naffected populations.  \n \nA needs assessment in the two target localities, including a market assessment, will precede the implementation of \nsectoral activities. \n \nLivelihoods and basic needs \n \n1. Food assistance for 400 households (2,000 people), for three months, through the implementation of an \nunconditional cash transfer programme \na. The Financial Service Provider will be identified and contracting will be completed with the support of the \nCash School specialist. The RCCV has on other occasions (e.g., COVID-19 response activities) agreed \nto ad hoc contracts with a financial services provider. \nb. The Cash School specialist will also contribute to building the capacity of the National Society through \nsustained support over six weeks, including the organization of training/retraining sessions for staff and \nvolunteers. \nc. Amount to be distributed: 12,350 CVE/month per household, for 3 months (i.e., 37,050 CVE/household), \ncalculated on the basis of the costs of the basic food basket (rice, maize, legumes, sugar, and oil) which \nguarantees the minimum ration of 2,100 kcal/person/day. \n \nItem \nQuantity \nUnit \nKcal/p/d \nPrice/unit (CVE) \nTotal price (CVE) \nGrains (rice, corn, flour, \netc.) \n50 \nkg \n1,210 \n140 \n7,000,00 \nLegume \n25 \nkg \n555 \n150 \n3,750,00 \nOil \n5 \nlitre \n295 \n170 \n850,00 \nSugar \n5 \nkg \n129 \n150 \n750,00 \n  \n \n \n2,189 \n \n12,350,00 \n \nMonthly food basket in Cape Verde for a household of 5 people \n \n2. Support to farmers and livestock breeders through the implementation of a cash transfer programme: \na. For farmers (100 households, 500 people): purchase of seeds and fertilizers. \nb. For herders (100 households, 500 people): purchase of feed and support for access to veterinary care. \nP a g e  | 10 \n \n \nInternal \nc. Amount to be distributed: a single transfer of 8,000 CVE/household. \n3. Additional support to livestock farmers (50 households, 250 individuals) through support for slaughter \ndestocking. \n4. Organization of sensitization sessions for farmers and herders, including in collaboration with the technical \nservices of the Ministry of Agriculture. \nDue to the availability of ATMs in the target areas and the presence of financial services, Cash Transfer Programming \nwill be organized. The implementation of the cash transfer programme will be based on lessons learned by the NS \nfrom previous operations. The British Red Cross Cash School will be supported by the deployment of a Cash and \nVoucher Assistance specialist to Cape Verde for a period of six weeks. This support will facilitate and accelerate the \nidentification of a Financial Service Provider that meets the needs of the operation and the IFRC's implementation \nstandards. \n \nHealth \n \n1. Organization of screening campaigns for malnutrition in the two targeted localities, reaching a total of 1,000 \npeople and allowing for the rapid referral of the most at-risk cases. \n2. Distribution of nutritional supplements for 200 people at risk (children aged 6 to 59 months and/or pregnant \nand lactating women), for a period of three months. \n3. Organization of nutrition awareness sessions and cooking demonstrations in the two target localities, reaching \na total of 500 people. \n \nWater, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) \n \n1. Initial assessment of the water, sanitation and hygiene situation in the two target localities. \n2. To ensure a steady supply of water to drought-affected families for both farm irrigation needs and livestock \nactivities, damaged reservoirs, wells and/or boreholes will be identified and rehabilitated. \na. A total of 12 reservoirs and 12 wells and/or boreholes will be identified and rehabilitated. \n3. Based on current information, communities are familiar with the use of water from boreholes. Restoration and \nmaintenance of damaged reservoirs, wells and/or boreholes are integrated to improve access to safer water. \nDistribution of buckets (14L) and jerry cans (10L) for water collection and storage to 500 households (2,500 \npeople). \na. Each household will receive 1 bucket and 2 jerry cans.  \n4. Water purification needs will be determined during the detailed assessment. For now, pending specific needs \nthat may be identified during the assessment, this involves providing water storage equipment for domestic \nuse, crops, and livestock. Hygiene promotion and awareness activities will be carried out in the two target \nlocalities, reaching 500 households (2,500 people). \n \nProtection, Gender and Inclusion (PGI) \n \n1. The initial needs assessment will help to collect and analyse data disaggregated by sex, age and disability \nstatus. \na. The assessment will pay particular attention to the different and distinct needs of women, girls, and \nboys and to needs by locality. It will identify priority cross-cutting actions in risk reduction and AIP. \n2. All sectors of intervention will seek to meet minimum AIP standards in emergency situations. \n3. Organize capacity building sessions on minimum standards for AIP in emergencies, with the support of the \nRCCV AIP Focal Point. \n4. Develop Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for protection and sexual and gender-based violence, \nincluding a mapping of actors, services and referral pathways. \n \nCommunity Engagement and Accountability (CEA) \n \n1. Community members will be consulted during the initial needs assessment, during the implementation of \nsupport activities, and during post-distribution follow-ups. \n2. Participatory approaches will be used to define and communicate selection criteria and validation, for example \nby working with community committees. \n3. Communities will be consulted and informed about the selection criteria and how they can contact the RCCV.  \na. A community feedback system will be established, including a hotline and follow-up during response \nactivities, to ensure that the views of targeted community members are incorporated. \nP a g e  | 11 \n \n \nInternal \nOperational Support Services \n \nHuman Resources \n \nThe RCCV will involve approximately 250 volunteers and professionals in this operation through its central (General \nSecretariat) and local (Local Councils) structures for approximately 4 months. \nFor sensitization activities, in particular the door-to-door visits to families, it will be necessary, once again, to call upon \nmore volunteers properly trained in sensitization, animation and beneficiary satisfaction survey techniques. \nThis estimate includes not only the beneficiaries in various communities, but also staff from other civil society \norganizations who, together, will contribute to the implementation of planned activities. \nAs part of this operation, a National Operations Coordinator with knowledge of food security and IFRC procedures will \nbe identified. He will report directly to the Director of the Disaster Management Department.  \n \nSimilarly, the RCCV will make available a finance person who will be completely dedicated to this operation. \nTwo counterparts (an Operations Manager with experience in cash and voucher assistance for 3 months and an \nAdministration and Finance profile for 2 months) will also be mobilized by the IFRC through the Rapid Response \nsystem to work with the RCCV on a peer-to-peer support basis. \n \nThe Food Security and Livelihoods delegate from the IFRC delegation in Dakar will also be made available to provide \nsupport to the RCCV, remotely and/or through an ad hoc technical support mission. \n \nLogistics and Supply Chain \n \nLogistics activities will focus on the effective management of the supply chain, including procurement, customs \nclearance, fleet, storage and transportation to distribution sites, in accordance with the requirements of the operation \nand IFRC logistics standards, processes and procedures. \n \nThe local supply chain for communities has been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and local prices are also \nfluctuating due to the crisis in Ukraine. The market and supply chain situation will be monitored by the NS as part of \nthis operation and the impact of international changes on the market, prices and access to goods and services needed \nfor food security in the country will be updated in the national contingency plan.  \n \nWith regard to material purchases under this operation, the NS will monitor prices and address any fluctuations that \nrequire a review or change in purchasing strategy. For the 3 months of operations, the RCCV will need field support \nto carry out the response. \n \nCommunication \n \nRCCV will share regular information and updates on the operation with key stakeholders. The operations manager will \nbe responsible for communication with external stakeholders. At operational level, the RCCV and IFRC will undertake \ncommunication activities to increase the visibility of the NS and demonstrate the impact of the Movement's contribution, \nincluding communications with media. The IFRC will support the documentation and publication of the stories on the \nIFRC website and the Go platform. \n \nInformation Technology (IT) \n \nTelephone calls and online communications are already underway between the technical departments at RCCV \nheadquarters and the IFRC, with government stakeholders and other partners. These exchanges will continue \nthroughout the operation to ensure the follow-up of the activities and to monitor the evolution of the situation. \n \nSecurity \n \nCape Verde is a country with stable security and no particular risk. However, in recent years there has been an increase \nin petty assaults and snatchings, particularly in Praia and Tarrafal de Santiago, also, to a lesser extent, in places with \nhigh tourist traffic (Mindelo in S\u00e3o Vicente, Santa Maria in Sal and Sal Rei in Boa Vista). \n \nRestrictions related to the application of sanitary measures in Cape Verde: since March 6, 2022, the state of sanitary \nemergency has been lifted and the Cape Verdean territory has been placed on alert. In this context, the following \nmeasures apply to everyone: the wearing of a mask (that remains recommended outdoor) is mandatory in all closed \nspaces, except for discotheques; to access events with more than 20 people, a certificate of recovery or complete \nvaccination against Covid-19 (with a mandatory booster dose if the last dose of this complete vaccination scheme is \nP a g e  | 12 \n \n \nInternal \nmore than 270 days) or proof of screening (PCR test of less than 72 hours or antigenic test of less than 48 hours) with \na negative test result must be presented. \n \nAll Red Cross Red Crescent personnel actively involved in operations must have completed the IFRC online Stay Safe \ncourses (personal safety, safety management or volunteer safety). The safety of the responders will be ensured \nthrough appropriate equipment and briefings on the risks associated with the operation and the COVID-19 \nenvironment. \n \nPlanning, Monitoring, Evaluation and reporting (PMER) \n \nOngoing monitoring will be carried out at country level and with IFRC. The RCCV will strive to ensure collaboration \nwith other Movement partners who will monitor the progress of the operation and provide the necessary technical \nexpertise. \n \nThe RCCV will ensure the monitoring and reporting of the operation. Brief weekly updates will be provided to the IFRC \nand other partners as relevant on the overall progress of the operation. Periodic reports defined in the funding \nagreements will provide details on the monitoring of indicators. \n \nPost-distribution monitoring will be conducted one week after the end of distributions. \n \nA DREF review will be conducted to assess the impact of this operation and a lessons learned workshop will also be \nheld as part of learning process. \n \nAdministration and Finance \n \nThe National Society has a permanent administration and finance department. A finance person will be fully dedicated \nto this operation. \n \nConsistent with the lessons learned from the RCCV's response to COVID-19, an Administration and Finance profile \nwill be mobilized through the Rapid Response system to strengthen the National Society's capacity and ensure \ncompliance with financial administrative procedures in accordance with the terms and conditions to be addressed in \nthe agreement between the NS and the IFRC. \n \n \n   \n \n \nP a g e  | 13 \n \n \nInternal \nC.

They do not have access to \ngood quality drinking water for their own consumption and for livestock and agriculture. Many people have to travel several kilometres to find drinking water or use \ntankers to irrigate their fields and give water to their livestock. Given the cost of water, many prefer to sell the livestock. It is therefore crucial to ensure that existing \nwater points, which are already insufficient, are protected. \n \nThe RCCV will implement a package of WASH activities in each target area, ensuring improved and sustainable access to safe water for people and livestock in \nunderserved and at-risk rural communities. Access to water will be improved through the rehabilitation of water points, shallow wells and pumping equipment (including \nthe installation of solar pumping systems). \n \nThe RCCV will promote hygiene and sanitation in the target areas by training volunteers and conducting awareness campaigns. Key messages on the prevention and \ntransmission of COVID-19 will be integrated into hygiene promotion. \n \nPopulation to be assisted:  \n\u2022 \nRepair and maintenance of tanks, wells and/or boreholes in identified localities: 6,026 people \n\u2022 \nDistribution of buckets and jerry cans: 1,000 households (5,000 people) \n\u2022 \nHygiene promotion and awareness activities: 500 households (2,500 people) \n \nImplementation standards: SPHERE Minimum standards. \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nP a g e  | 17 \n \n \nInternal \nP&B \nOutput \nCode  \n \n \n \nWASH Outcome 1: Immediate reduction in risk of waterborne diseases in targeted \ncommunities  \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n# of people reached by awareness raising activities \n(target: 80%) \n \n \nWASH Output 1.1: Detailed assessment of the water, sanitation and hygiene situation is \nconducted in target communities \n \n# of WASH assessments conducted (target: 2) \nPlanned activities \nWeek / Month \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 \n16 \n AP026 \nConduct an initial assessment of the water, sanitation and hygiene \nsituation in target communities \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n AP026 \nMonitor the water, sanitation and hygiene situation in target \ncommunities \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nP&B \nProduct \nCode \nWASH output 1.2: Daily access to safe water in quantity and quality that meets Sphere and \nWHO standards is ensured for the target population \n# of tanks rehabilitated (target: 12) \n# of wells or boreholes rehabilitated (target: 12) \n# of buckets distributed (target: 500) \n# of jerry cans distributed (target: 1,000) \nPlanned activities \nWeek / Month \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 \n16 \nAP026 \nTank repair and maintenance \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nAP026 \nRepair and maintenance of wells and/or boreholes \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAP026 \nDistribution of buckets and jerry cans \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nP&B \nProduct \nCode \n \nWASH product 1.4: Hygiene promotion activities that meet Sphere standards for \nidentification and use of hygiene products provided to the target population  \n \n# of volunteers trained (target: 40) \n# of awareness sessions (target: 10) \n# households reached with key messages to promote \npersonal and community hygiene (target: 500) \nPlanned activities \nWeek / Month \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 \n16 \n AP030 \nTrain Red Cross volunteers on water, sanitation and hygiene \nsituation assessment \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nAP030 \nSelect target groups, key messages and communication \nmethods \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAP030 \nDesign and print awareness-raising materials \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAP030 \nOrganise hygiene and sanitation awareness sessions \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nP a g e  | 18 \n \n \nInternal \n \n \nNeeds analysis: The duration of the crisis, and the time exposed to the lack of means to provide families with the basic needs, puts pressure on the heads of \nhouseholds, especially single-parent households or households with a high dependency ratio, and mainly those headed by women, people with disabilities and \nelderly people, with a greater workload or fewer resources to meet household needs. In view of this situation, the CRCV will assess these cases to prioritise them \nas a target group and include protection support activities, if necessary. RCCV will learn on the experience, training and support of its partners to ensure inclusive \nmeasures throughout the operation. \nThe RCCV will conduct protection activities through the training of volunteers in each target area.

Situation analysis \n \nDescription of the disaster  \n \nIraq is frequently at odds with regional neighbours over water issues. The country depends on the Tigris and Euphrates \nrivers for nearly all of its water. Millions of Iraqis face an intolerably harsh summer, which is causing alarm and creating \nmajor water shortages in the country. The rivers, which account for more than 90 per cent of Iraq\u2019s freshwater, are at \nEmergency Plan of Action (EPoA) \nIraq: Droughts  \n \nP a g e  | 2 \n \n \n \n \n \nInternal \nhistorically low levels due to a lack of winter rainfall in the region and snowmelt, primarily in the mountains of southern \nTurkey, which feeds into the rivers.  \nAs summer approaches, upstream water sources \nhave also shrunk the Tigris tributaries, cutting off \nthe flow at the Diyala river and decreasing the flow \nof the Lower Zaab river by 70 per cent. This has \ncaused a major crisis in the governorates of \nDiyala, Ninewa, and Basra, and farmers are now \ncounting their losses. According to experts and \nofficials, the effect of this plunge in water levels \ncould destroy the ecology, worsen household \nwater quality, which in most areas is already \nunsafe to drink and increase soil salinity, leaving \nbarren land that was once fertile. Dropping water \nlevels will have an impact on irrigated agriculture \nwith less water flow, which can have a serious \nimpact on food security, while the drought may \nalso make vegetation more susceptible to \nwildfires. Climate change has also exacerbated \nthe crisis; evaporation rates are increasing as \nglobal temperatures rise. Dams on the Tigris and \nEuphrates are causing growing water shortages \nfor irrigation, endangering agricultural production; \naccess to drinking water in towns and villages is \nalso jeopardized. According to Iraq\u2019s Minister of \nWater Resources, Iraq could face a water shortage of up to 10.8 billion cubic meters per year by 2035. The influence \nof climate change on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers basins is currently being investigated by the countries concerned. \nOne sensitive issue is that more than have of Iraq\u2019s water relies on precipitation falling outside its borders, making the \nwater resources management in the country vulnerable to climate change and storage projects in neighbouring \ncountries. To cope with water scarcity, the Agriculture Ministry has prohibited summer planting of rice, corn, and \nvegetables, allowing only water to reach palm trees and fruit orchards. Mismanagement of water resources in Iraq, such \nas inefficient flood irrigation methods, rundown water pipe infrastructure, and the cultivation of water-intensive crops \nlike rice, compound the problem. As a result of Iraq\u2019s failure to address these issues over years of sanctions and war, \nthe combined reservoir storage capacity of upriver dams has increased. Desertification is a sweeping environmental \nissue, with far-reaching consequences. Climate change is expected to raise Iraq\u2019s mean annual temperature by 2\u00b0C, \nwhile decreasing its mean annual average rainfall by 9 percent by 2050, leading to frequent heatwaves and droughts. \nProlonged droughts have taken a toll on rain-fed crops, while decreased flow of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers in Iraq \nhas deteriorated water quality and further increased salinity in irrigated areas, resulting in a significant decline in crop \nproductivity as well as the net growing area.1 \n \nIraq\u2019s Ministry of Water Resources, WFP, the Global Water Stress Index, and the European Commission\u2019s Joint \nResearch Centre on 23 August, the unfolding water crisis will soon become an unprecedented catastrophe across Iraq. \nThe country now faces a complex water crisis that has humanitarian, economic, security, and social implications. These \ninclude population movements, losses of agriculture and livelihoods, mass demonstrations, and increased risks of food \ninsecurity and communicable diseases.2 Since autumn 2020, unseasonably low levels of rainfall across the eastern \nregion of the Mediterranean Basin, have contributed to drought conditions in Iraq. More than 12 million people in Iraq \nand Syria are losing access to water, food, and electricity, and urgent action is needed to combat a severe water crisis. \nRising temperatures, record low levels of rainfall, and drought are depriving people of drinking and agricultural water. It \nis also disrupting electricity as dams run out of water, which in turn impacts the operations of essential infrastructure \nincluding health facilities. Higher temperatures caused by climate change increase the risks and severity of droughts.3 \n \nIraq\u2019s Ministry of Water Resources on 25 May, water flowing into Iraq has dropped from a peak of nearly 80 billion cubic \nmetres per year in the 1970s to less than 50 billion cubic metres today. The ministry expressed concern about the drop \nin water levels in the country's major rivers and water storage, which was 50 percent lower than the previous year. Due \nto climatic conditions and the fact that both the Tigris and Euphrates (as well as other major rivers) are vulnerable to \nupstream water use and damming in other countries, water scarcity is a recurring problem in Iraq.

Basic services are deteriorating \nin many places and there is a growing imbalance between water supply and demand.  \n \nIn a nation of 40 million people, seven million Iraqis have already been affected by drought and the risk of displacement \nthat it entails. Based on Iraq\u2019s high population growth rate, estimates suggest that the country\u2019s population will grow \nfrom 38 million today to 80 million by 2050, heightening the economic and social risks of climate change is left \nunaddressed.4 \n \nOn 9 May, Diyala governorate authorities issued a drought and water shortage alert, as inflow from the Diyala river is \ndramatically reduced and the main water storage, the Hamrin and Darbandikhan lakes is depleted. This river begins \ndownstream of the Darbandikhan Dam and has several tributaries, including Tanjero in Iraq and Sirwan in Iran, which \nis the main tributary in terms of discharges. Diyala governorate has experienced several floods and droughts over the \nlast century, depending on rainfall and water management. A chronic water shortage has developed in recent years. \nWhile population and water demand have increased, average rainfall has decreased by approx. 50% over the last two \ndecades, attributed to climate change. Water flows from neighbouring countries have been reduced, resulting in the \nloss of 77 percent of the Diyala river's catchment area outside of Iraq. The recent storage capacity of more than a dozen \nof dams in the area is approximately 1.9 billion cubic meters, with 1 billion cubic meters diverted annually by newly \nconstructed diversion tunnels outside the river basin. Furthermore, the limited water resources and irrigation are \nmismanaged in Iraq. \n  \nThe water levels of lake Hamrin have been dropping since 2019, and the area covered by water has been shrinking by \nabout half. The Iraqi Kurdistan Region (IKR) is located in the north of Iraq, which has also suffered from extreme drought. \nIraq is a semi-arid country that suffers from recurrent droughts. Climate change is continuously increasing the frequency \nand severity of the drought phenomenon in Iraq over the past years. In addition to pollution and climate change, Iraq\u2019s \nwater resources face the threat of mega water projects. Prolonged heat waves, erratic precipitation, higher than average \ntemperatures, and increased disaster intensity are putting additional strain on Iraq\u2019s post-war environment. \n \nAcross the country, the first substantial rainfall of the season in November 2020 facilitated sowing activities that were \ncompleted by mid-December and early crop prospects were relatively promising. In central and southern parts of the \ncountry, where crops require supplementary irrigation, the season proceeded under reasonably favourable conditions, \nand the development of cereal crops, despite above-average temperatures, was satisfactory. In northern parts of the \ncountry, sporadic and insufficient precipitation in Ninewa Governorate as well as portions of north-eastern Dahuk, Erbil, \nSulaymaniyah, and Salah Al Din provinces, affected conditions of mainly rainfed winter cereals. Rainfall in March and \nearly April, which would have been critical to saving the crops, did not materialize. In May, extreme temperatures (35-\n40\u00b0C) further reduced the already meagre yield prospects for winter grains in drought-affected areas.  \n \n \n4 For war-scarred Iraq, climate crisis the next great threat - President Barham Saleh, 08/07/2021 \nP a g e  | 4 \n \n \n \n \n \nInternal \nCurrently, around two million Iraqis face food insecurity. With water depletion, there are security risks associated with \nwater depletion, which could be exacerbated by drought and climate change.5 Iraq is struggling how to deal with \ndwindling upstream water flows. Balancing the needs of the environment and agriculture in Iraq is a challenge, and the \nIraqi government lacks a clear management plan for the future. Despite the fact that water is used for human \nconsumption, agriculture, and marshland supply, Iraq has no water distribution plan, even though water from upstream \nis less. The Iraqi government needs to ensure that all Iraqis have access to clean water and basic services.6 Drought is \none of the most complex natural disasters; it is still challenging to identify its cause and range of development. Drought \nhas been a severe recurring phenomenon in Iraq over the last two decades due to climate change, although Iraq has \nhistorically been one of the most water-rich countries in the Middle East.  \nThe recent drought trend analysis in a semi-arid area of Iraq is based on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. The \nlack of precipitation exacerbated already-existing regional tensions over water resources management. The major rivers \nin the area (Tigris and Euphrates), provide the majority of irrigation water. It is estimated that a reduced amount of water \nstreams into the country due to the construction of dams upstream outside of Iraqi territory. Upstream countries also \nincreased water withdrawals to meet their increased needs as a result of population growth and increased water \nconsumption. In northern parts of the country, sporadic and insufficient precipitation in Ninewa Governorate as well as \nportions of north-eastern Dahuk, Erbil, Sulaymaniyah, and Salah Al Din provinces, affected conditions of mainly rainfed \nwinter cereals and production is expected to be significantly lower than last year. On 25 May 2021 at the Humanitarian \nCountry Team meeting, UNFAO presented a worsening drought that is threatening agriculture and livelihoods in the \nDhi Qar Governorate of Iraq, 300 kilometres south of Baghdad. Other southern agricultural governorates, including Al-\nQ\u0101disiyyah, Muthanna, and Missan, are also suffering under the effects of the drought. The southern agricultural \nprovinces of Iraq are home to nearly a quarter of the total population of the country. The drought is placing increasing \npressure on agricultural families, with dozens of families moving out of at least 20 villages in the area.7 \n \nIraq faces a unique set of environmental challenges, the impacts of changing weather patterns have already been felt \nin recent years, with increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and rising environmental degradation \nthroughout the country. As demographic growth puts further strain on natural resources that are becoming increasingly \nscarce, the government\u2019s capacity to devise and implement the necessary adaptation and mitigation policies is \nhampered by a daunting context of post-conflict reconstruction. The water crisis in the country is expected to persist \nand may have humanitarian, economic, security, and social ramifications, including population movements. The most \nserious long-term threat to the country, however, is the potential economic impact and environmental devastation \ncaused by climate change. According to the UN Environment Program, Iraq is the fifth most vulnerable country in the \n \n5 UNDRR: Special Report on Drought 2021 \n6 Ensuring Iraqis\u2019 access to clean water in times of scarcity: Submission to the United Nations Universal Periodic Review 34th Session, \n4-15 November 2019  \n7 OCHA Iraq Humanitarian Bulletin May 2021 \nFigure 2: Source FAO/Earth Observation System \nP a g e  | 5 \n \n \n \n \n \nInternal \nworld to the effects of climate change.

Photo by: IRCS \nSummary of the current response \n \nOverview of Host National Society Response Action \nIRCS has a long-term record of providing life-saving assistance to people in need in Iraq. IRCS presence and local \nnetworks are exceptionally well established across the country, allowing IRCS to also reach vulnerable populations who \nare not served by other humanitarian actors, such as in remote areas. IRCS has extensive expertise with various types \nof programming through multilateral projects supported by the IFRC, ICRC, and Movement partners. This includes youth \ndevelopment, disaster risk management, cash, and voucher assistance (CVA), community-based health and first aid \n(CBHFA), restoring family links, community resilience (including WASH and livelihoods, etc.), dissemination of \ninternational humanitarian law (IHL), humanitarian values, and Red Cross/Red Crescent principles, and rehabilitation \nfor physically disabled people for internally displaced people (IDP).   \n \nIRCS volunteers play a critical role at all stages of the organization\u2019s programmes. This includes assessment, \nidentification, and registration of target communities and internally displaced populations. Since, IRCS is dealing with \ndisaster response, health services, volunteerism, community-based disaster risk reduction, organizational development, \nand dissemination of humanitarian values. The IRCS disaster management is capable of the implementation of large-\nscale and long-term preparedness and response programs due to its nationwide coverage through 18 governorates \nbranches and a national network of volunteers. Through all the years of conflict, it has consistently provided assistance \nto a multitude of vulnerable Iraqis all over the country. The branches in targeted areas have teams of trained volunteers \nin disaster preparedness and response such as the National/Branch Response Team (N/BRT), Community Based \nHealth & First Aid (CBHFA), health and hygiene promotion, etc., and being involved in operation activities through the \ngovernorate\u2019s branches. Specifically in June, IRCS NRT members, as part of preparedness for effective response, were \ntrained on conducting Emergency Needs Assessment including multi-sectorial assessments and have obtained skills, \ntemplates, and forms on such exercise, with clear standard operating procedures on activation of the NRT members.   \nIn addition, volunteers service to carry out hygiene promotion and community mobilization. \n \nIRCS on June 20, has organized a meeting with the IFRC Iraq country delegation, MENA, and with other Movement \npartners on the current drought situation in Iraq and how to address the needs of the affected population. This meeting \nhas several positive results and mainly looking into the development of the IRCS response plan together with the \n \n8 Climate change in Iraq: June 2021 \nP a g e  | 6 \n \n \n \n \n \nInternal \ntechnical leads. The work plan initial outlines have the following sectors: i) Food & Economic security ii) WASH and iii) \nHealth. While ensuring DRR and capacity-strengthening are mainstreamed across all sectors and also all activities to \nbe COVID-19 sensitive. Drought planning Working Group from IRCS, IFRC, German Red Cross (GRC), and  French \nRed Cross (FRC) can be established to support IRCS planning efforts.  \n \nOverview of Red Cross Red Crescent Movement Actions in-country \nThe IFRC is having regular coordination and communication with the IRCS. The IRCS disaster management teams and \nvolunteers in the governorates are engaged to collect the information and to conduct rapid need assessments. Based \non the completion of rapid assessment IRCS will convene a meeting with in-country Movement partners, the IFRC, and \nthe ICRC to discuss the drought situation and the IRCS response plan. The IFRC Iraq country delegation is supporting \nIRCS in disseminating updates to the MENA regional office. The IFRC delegation is supporting to Iraq Red Crescent \nSociety in implementing the COVID-19 Emergency Appeal which focuses on i) health, ii) WASH and iii) food security as \nwell as National Society Development initiatives.   \n \nIRCS Headquarters maintains daily communication with the IFRC Iraq delegation in Baghdad. Monthly Task Force \nmeetings with Movement partners in-country are taking place to discuss and plan activities that will improve the \ncollective capacity and impact. To avoid duplication of support, the DREF operation was launched with coordination \nand consultation with Movement partners in the country. The Movement partners present in Iraq include ICRC, German, \nNorwegian, Danish, Turkish, Qatar, and Swedish Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies. Since the drought \nsituation is exacerbating, the IFRC country delegation in Iraq has contacted the IRCS leadership and technical \ndepartments and the IFRC regional office to share information about the drought, its impact, and response plans, as \nwell as to provide technical support for the DREF.  \n \nThe in-country PNSs in Iraq are supporting the IRCS with health interventions; water, sanitation, and hygiene promotion \n(WASH); psychosocial support (PSS); cash and voucher assistance (CVA), community-based health and first aid \n(CBHFA), volunteer management, and youth mobilization operations throughout the governorates, in collaboration with \nthe IFRC and other Movement partners. ICRC supports the civilians in improving livelihood and water and sanitation, \nhealth, Restoring Family Links (RFL), and tracing activities. The ICRC supports the IRCS in its development and \noperations, as a primary partner with a focus on the \u201cSafer Access\u201d approach that promotes safer access to people \naffected by conflict and other forms of violence, whilst minimizing risks to staff and volunteers.  \n \nThere is a strong need for all Movement partners to prioritize Strengthening of Movement Coordination and Cooperation \n(SMCC) to provide effective and coherent support to the National Society, such as a coordinated approach to \norganizational development and capacity building.  \n \nOverview of non-RCRC actors\u2019 actions in-country \nThe Iraqi Government is closely monitoring the drought situation in the country. According to the HCT and UNFAO, a \nworsening drought is threatening agriculture and livelihoods in the Ninewa, Basra, and Diyala governorates. The Ministry \nof Health and environment of Iraq working together with the WHO and other stakeholders to effectively improve the \npublic health situation in the country with special emphasis on; (i) health security and prevention and control of \ncommunicable diseases; (ii) non-communicable diseases, mental health, violence and injuries, and nutrition; (iii) \npromoting health through the life-course; (iv) health systems strengthening; and (v) preparedness, surveillance and \nresponse. Cluster meetings occur monthly at the national level and are coordinated by the respective cluster lead \nagencies through Cluster Coordinators. Meetings are attended by cluster partners, members, and observers and aim \nto strategize and coordinate humanitarian activities at the cluster or sector level, as well as to share information on \nchallenges and bottlenecks faced at the operational level. The Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) serves as a strategic, \npolicy level, and decision-making forum that guides principled humanitarian action in Iraq. The Iraq Humanitarian Forum \n(AHF) is composed of all heads of International and National humanitarian NGOs and feeds into the HCT. The Iraq \nHumanitarian Fund (IHF) meets monthly and focuses on the coordination of NGO activities at the national and sub-\nnational levels, advocacy on issues affecting the work of NGOs, representation/communication on the interests of NGOs \nto other humanitarian stakeholders and the government, and promotion of high ethical and professional standards \namongst the NGO community. Other agencies implementing humanitarian activities related to the drought response \nincludes UN Agencies: WFP, UNDP, UNOCHA, FAO, WHO, UNICEF, IOM, and other INGOs implementing water and \nsanitation activities while Save the Children, OXFAM, ACF, ACTED, Norwegian and Danish Refugee Councils are \nimplementing nutritional support projects through health centres and food assistance through Cash and Voucher \nAssistance (CVA). \n \nThe Iraq Humanitarian Fund announced the first Standard Allocation in April 2021, which will grant up to $13.5 million \nto address the key response gaps identified in the 2021 Humanitarian Response Plan. This allocation specifically targets \nout-of-camp IDPs in underserved locations and vulnerable returnees living in critical shelters, supporting these groups \nwith targeted protection assistance, improved access to essential health and WASH services, and emergency livelihood \nsupport. In line with the IHF\u2019s continued commitment to promoting localization since 2019, the Humanitarian Coordinator \nP a g e  | 7 \n \n \n \n \n \nInternal \nand the Advisory Board endorsed the consortium approach for the first Standard Allocation, whereby funds are allocated \nto multiple humanitarian actors through a single lead agency working in equal partnership with consortium members.9 \n \nNeeds analysis, targeting, scenario planning, and risk assessment \n \nNeeds analysis \nIraq has experienced multiple crises in recent years as a result of a series of natural disasters that have exacerbated \nthe country\u2019s humanitarian needs. The protracted humanitarian crisis in Iraq remains one of the largest and most volatile \nin the world. After years of armed conflict and instability, the health sector in Iraq is struggling to meet the dire needs. \nThe humanitarian needs in Iraq continue to be extremely high. Iraq is a diverse country with highly complex and \nmultidimensional social divides spanning generations, religions, rural and urban groups, internally displaced people and \nhost communities, and political interests. Despite this, sectarian identities continue to harm social cohesion in specific \nlocations. COVID-19 effects on these tensions appear to be mixed. The COVID-19 outbreak hit a country already in the \ngrip of a humanitarian crisis, further deepening vulnerabilities, and disrupting ongoing efforts to deliver aid to the most \nvulnerable people in acute need of humanitarian assistance. The people most in need of such assistance continue to \nbe those directly affected by the conflicts and recently affected by the pandemic compromising of IDPs, refugees, \nreturnees, and host communities in and out of camps. The political, economic, and social instability in Iraq is challenging \nthe humanitarian response. The country was still recovering from the massive conflict that resulted in population \nmovement in 2014 when the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020. These circumstances have had a significant impact \non livelihoods and have exacerbated food insecurity. Current high-security alerts and potential escalation of \ndemonstrations over the ever-rising hardship, in addition to the potential for violence to accompany the election process, \nmay pose additional challenges to those who rely on a daily irregular income. After one year with COVID-19, with the \npassage of time and current economic deterioration, many families have limited and low income in the country. The \nnumber of poor and needy families grows as a result of these multiple crises. \n \nAcross the region, rising temperatures, record low levels of rainfall, and drought are depriving people of drinking and \nagricultural water. It is also disrupting electricity as dams run out of water, which in turn impacts the operations of \nessential infrastructure including health facilities. Higher temperatures caused by climate change increase the risks \nand severity of droughts. In Iraq, the loss of access to water from the river, and drought, threaten more than seven \nmillion people. Some 400 square kilometres of agricultural land risk total drought. In Iraq, the loss of access to water \nfrom the river, and drought, impacted more than seven million people. The large swathes of farmland, fisheries, power \nproduction, and drinking water sources have been depleted of water. In the region, Tigris and Euphrates rivers are \ncurrently experiencing drought conditions, resulting in lower river flow, and affecting dam storage. The current season \nis the second driest in 40 years. Iraq is anticipating a serious drought this summer following a particularly dry winter \nand reduced river flow caused by upstream damming programs by riparian countries. Climate change has potential \nimpacts on food security such as reduction in wheat production, decrease in surface water storage, drying of \nshallower wells due to insufficient groundwater recharge, and an increase in the cost of water. If the dry conditions \ncontinue, and the water reservoirs are not replenished, the population will face an acute water shortage for irrigation \nof the next cropping season. The country depends on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers for nearly all its water, has been \nfrequently at odds over water issues. \n \nThe historical period covered 1900-2009, is divided into four sub-periods as follows: first 1900-1930, second 1930-1960, \nthird 1960-1990, and fourth 1990-2009. The future period covered (2020-2099), was also divided into four sub-periods \nas follows: first 2020-2039, second 2040-2059, third 2060-2079, and fourth 2080-2099. In recent decades the important \nfeature of the climatic in Iraq is the increase of temperature by 0.2 - 0.30 \u00b0C per decade, rainfall less, loss of winter \nprecipitation. Strong in snow mass including summer drought. The future expectation is that Iraq will be warmer, drier, \nand more global average in the MENA region. \n \nConcerning the humanitarian situation - the high number of people living under extremely precarious conditions, it can \nbe assumed a high risk of impacts on their livelihoods, and access to sufficient and safe water. The drought has lasted \nfor 9 months in Iraq. Drought indicators suggest anomalies typical of severe to extreme events. The most severe food \ninsecurity conditions among IDPs living out-of-camps are reported in the governorates of Ninewa, Duhok, Erbil, and \nSalah Al Din, while the majority of the returnees are concentrated in the governorates of Ninewa, Salah Al Din, Anbar, \nand Kirkuk. According to the KRI authorities, crop production of 2021 is 50 percent lower than the exceptional harvest \nof 2020. Department of Agriculture of Ninewa Governorate forecasted the crop production in 2021 is over 70 percent \nless than the harvested in 2020 and over 50 percent lower than harvested in 2019. The other southern agricultural \ngovernorates are also suffering under the effects of the drought. The drought has greatly harmed Ninawa's grain \nproduction, especially wheat, with production decreasing from one million tonnes last season to about 395,000 tonnes \nin the current season. Government grain silos are now purchasing wheat from farmers. \n \n \n9 OCHA Iraq Humanitarian Bulletin, May 2021 \nP a g e  | 8 \n \n \n \n \n \nInternal \nThe below graph shows the historical and future climate change scenarios for temperature and rainfall for \nIraq.10 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAccording to the Kurdish Region of Iraq (KRI) authorities, production of the 2021 wheat crop is forecast at about 750,000 \ntonnes, 50 percent lower than the exceptional harvest of 2020. In May 2021, the local Department of Agriculture of \nNinewa Governorate forecasted the 2021 wheat output at 394,000 tonnes, over 70 percent less than the 1.4 million \ntonnes harvested in 2020 and over 50 percent lower than the 850,000 tonnes harvested in 2019. The 2021 barley crop \nfailed, and production is forecast at a negligible level of 11,510 tonnes, down from the 1.36 million tonnes harvested in \n2020 and the 1.3 million tonnes harvested in 2019. The livelihoods of livestock producers are likely to be severely \naffected by the decline in barley production. By mid-April 2021, when widespread crop failure in northern areas was \nconfirmed, feed prices steeply increased at a rate much faster than seasonally justified. The affected farmers may \nconsider reducing the size of their herds, selling some animals in order to improve their cash flow and be able to feed \nthe remaining livestock. A large number of livestock keepers started moving to western and northern regions of Ninewa \nand Kurdistan areas looking after pastures and grazing areas.11 Most of the governorates are already affected by the \nprotracted conflict and recently drought, people are living without enough basic service. Around 2 million Iraqis are \ncurrently food insecure.12 \n \nIRCS local branches carried out a rapid assessment from 27 July to 5 August in three drought-affected governorates: \nNinewa, Diyala, and Basra. In the Ninewa governorate, IRCS teams organized a meeting with the relevant authorities \nto collect information on the current drought's impact on people.

Having said by the governorate authorities, if the situation continues, the dry weather and reduced water \nsupplies are already impacting the food security, livelihoods, and access to water of already vulnerable populations, \nprimarily of communities residing in the Ninewa governorate, which recorded up to 40 per cent below normal \nprecipitation. \n \n \nFigure 4: IRCS Ninewa branch team field visit and interviews with local farmers. Photo by: IRCS \nDiyala is another governorate at risk of drought and water shortage, due to its reliance on Lake Hamrin, fed by the \nDiyala river, which originates as the Sirwan River. The water levels in Lake Hamrin have dropped significantly over the \npast year, with the surface area covered with water shrinking by half, affecting irrigation and agriculture, and impacting \npotential returns. Diyala governorate administration conducted a meeting on 20th June at General Secretariat of the \nCouncil Ministers - Joint Coordination and Monitoring Centre with the Department of Water Resources, Environment, \nAgriculture, and Civil Defense. According to authorities, Diyala lost more than 70% of its water revenues due to the \nscarcity of rain and the absence of projects and plans for control and storage over the past years. Despite efforts to \nprovide water, the lack of rainfall has had a huge impact on the agricultural sector, especially wheat and barley yields \nwhich have decreased by 35%. The vegetable and fruit products have decreased by about 50%, and the effect of \ndrought on orchards gardens in the summer will be similarly bad compared to 2020. The production of abandoned lands \nhas become zero. \n \nAccording to the local communities, 15 villages in Al-Mansouriyah district might be forced to displace due to drought \nand potable water shortage. Water projects in several villages in al-Mansouriyah district (45 km northeast of Baquba) \nhad been suspended due to the dryness of rivers (Sharween and al-Shawhani) and the water resources department\u2019s \nrefusal to release water for unknown reasons. People are called on the concerned authorities to find urgent solutions to \nthe tragedy of villages suffering from thirst and drought. Otherwise, 13 to 15 villages will be forced to leave their homes. \nMiqdadiyah, Bald Ruz, Mandali, Qazan, and Kanaan will be the most affected by the coming drought crisis this summer \ndue to the lack of water revenues and the drought of all channels and irrigation streams, which prompted many farmers \nto migrate the agricultural profession and head towards cities. Diyala governorate is suffering from drought which has \ncaused significant damage to farmers and the agricultural sector, as well as a severe shortage of drinking water. A lack \nof rainfall and water shortages throughout the winter have led many farmers to abandon their lands. The severe rainfall \nshortage has affected agricultural products and contributed to the further deterioration of the economic situation of \nfarmers in Diyala compared to previous years. \n \nP a g e  | 10 \n \n \n \n \n \nInternal \n \nFigure 5: Diyala river and its tributaries in 2021 after depleted the water. Photo by: IRCS \nMore than one million dunams of farmland have become barren in the provinces of Dhi Qar, Maysan, Karbala, Najaf, \nand Basra, according to the Iraqi Ministry of Agriculture. The levels of the Tigris River in Baghdad have also noticeably \nreduced. The Ministry of Water has stated the river\u2019s water level has decreased by 47 percent since 2003. The decrease \nin water levels is from natural sources, primarily a lack of rainfall. Before 2003, there were 500 cubic meters of water \nflowing, this has now been reduced to only 320 cubic meters. In southern Iraq, where the two big streams merge into \nthe Shatt al-Arab, the reduced flow has caused saltwater intrusion from the Gulf, degrading the waterway that is shaded \nby lush palm groves on its banks. The primary water source for Basra is the Shatt al-Arab river and its freshwater canals, \nthough for decades water infrastructure has been neglected and laws against dumping waste into the river have not \nbeen enforced. As Iraq bakes in the blistering summer heat, its hardscrabble farmers and livestock herders are battling \nsevere water shortages that are killing their animals, fields, and way of life. Drought has hit the Mesopotamian marshes, \nsaid to be the site of the biblical Garden of Eden, where water buffalos and their owners once found respite from summer \nheat above 50 degrees Celsius. \n \nAccording to the United Nations, only 3.5 percent of Iraq's farmlands are watered with irrigation systems. The UN has \nwarned about the effects of climate changes in many countries, including Iraq, which loses about 100,000 acres of \nagricultural land per year and still primarily uses outdated irrigation systems which have caused the salinization of soil. \nThe potential human costs of climate change are immense.  \n \nThe Humanitarian Needs Overview for Iraq identified 4.1 million people in need, of which 2.4 million people have acute \nhumanitarian needs COVID-19 pandemic compounded with protracted displacement - resulted in increased protection \nneeds and vulnerabilities. While the number of people in need remained similar to the previous year, the severity of \nthose needs increased, largely due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on top of an existing humanitarian crisis, \nleading to a 35 percent increase in the number of people in acute need. Extreme poverty and inequality have meant \nthat significant portions of the population are in urgent need of employment, health care, education, sanitation, hygiene, \nand access to justice. Shortfalls have worsened with the oil price drop, which has had a major effect on government \nrevenues and fiscal space. Thousands of jobs are at risk, and while food prices have remained relatively stable, \ncontinued reliance on imported food makes the country vulnerable to shortages or major price increases. \n \nP a g e  | 11 \n \n \n \n \n \nInternal \n \nFigure 6: Water buffaloes in the central marshland of Basra. Photo by: Photo by: IRCS  \nThe main challenges and needs facing the communities of the Ninewa, Diyala, and Basra governorates are: \n \nLivelihoods and food security: In most of the area agricultural land is completely affected by the current drought spell \nand left people with more vulnerability. The sharp reduction in agricultural production and the depletion of food reserves \nare increasing the dependence of families on the purchase of food in the market. Normally most people's food sources \ncome from their own agricultural or livestock production in Iraq. Native communities get their food mainly from sources \nprovided by the fields and nature. The drought has negatively impacted the access to and availability of food sources \ndue to crop losses (wheat, corn, soybeans, among others). Faced with this situation, families are using negative coping \nstrategies, reducing the number and size of meals, mainly affecting vulnerable groups such as children under five, \npregnant women, the elderly, and people with acute and chronic illnesses.  \nThe most immediate effect on income and livelihoods stems from a decision on 11 June by the Ministry of Water \nResources (MoWR) and the Department for Agriculture (DoA) to prohibit the planting of summer crops in Diyala, except \nfor Khalis district.13 Irrigation focuses only on the perennial orchards. Communities with war-damaged irrigation channels \nor irrigation channels that are dried out with the lower water levels rely on municipal water supply. This has first effects \non production and food prices, daily labour opportunities, and communities\u2019 competition for water sources.14 \nThere is a need to implement the interventions for the collection and storage of water from natural sources, dig wells \nand conduct food distributions. The main needs are related to securing basic food sources, especially for the population \nat risk, supporting the early recovery of farming-related livelihoods, risk, and recovery of animal production, which will \nbe important for the food security of the population. The drought jeopardizes household food, nutrition, and economic \nsecurity, calling into question their ability to meet their basic needs in the coming months and invest in their livelihoods \nto recover from the last failed agricultural season. Thus, the priority needs of affected households lie in the coverage of \nimmediate food needs, and livelihood restoration intervention. \n \nCash Voucher Assistance (CVA): IRCS has an experience in CVA, Cash transfers in Iraq are a well-established \nresponse modality for the delivery of humanitarian aid with experienced humanitarian actors, financial service providers \n(FSPs), a good policy environment, and a dynamic country Cash Working Group. Additionally, the mobile money \ncompanies operating in Iraq provide practical pieces of training to affected people who have not used mobile money \nservices before. Under this operation, a one-off multipurpose cash transfer will be distributed to 1,500 households for \nbasic needs and restoring livelihoods respectively. The proposed transfer value of USD 100 per household has been \ncalculated based on the market price of items using the Iraq minimum household of 6 persons. The IRCS will engage \nand contract a mobile money company to support the mobile money transfer services to the targeted people. IFRC Iraq \ncountry delegation through MENA cash and procurement team will provide the technical support to IRCS for this \nprocess. After validation of the file by IFRC, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) will be prepared and signed by \nboth parties; IRCS and financial service providers before the services commence. IRCS will ensure data protection and \nclarify the roles and responsibilities when dealing with beneficiary data with financial service providers. For IRCS monthly \nreconciliation, mobile money operators will also provide electronic and printed reports for all transactions made in a \n \n13 Reference Date: GIEWS Country Brief, The Republic of Iraq, 11-June-2021 \n14 Water Scarcity and Drought Risk - Diyala ICCG update 17 June 2021 \nP a g e  | 12 \n \n \n \n \n \nInternal \ngiven month. The cost of mobile money transfers is estimated to be 2.5 to 3% of the transfer amount. Apart from CVA \ninterventions, IRCS will procure 3,000 food packages for drought-affected families, which will be distributed across three \ngovernorates.  \n \nHealth and care: The protracted humanitarian crisis, compounded by COVID-19, took its toll on Iraq in 2020. The \nunstable security situation, lack of employment, and basic services experiencing distressing events, uncertainty also \ncontinued to fuel large-scale population displacement and have a negative impact on their lives. These factors, together \nwith the closure of camps for internally displaced people (IDPs), meant that the most vulnerable people are in acute \nneed of food and livelihoods assistance, WASH, and health, Mental Health, and Psychosocial Support in the country. \nThe capacity of the national health system became severely overstretched and had difficulties in meeting the health \nneeds of the country. The limited availability of primary healthcare services, the lack of sufficient trained health \npersonnel, the destroyed or inadequate healthcare infrastructure, shortages of medicines and medical supplies, and the \nstruggle to cope with such life events having additional pressure due to different critical incidence and violent crackdowns \nin the country, which requires more Community Health interventions through the well-trained, community health \nvolunteers that can play a key role in ensuring that these challenges are met in an effective, efficient and timely manner.  \nespecially that many health facilities that are still operating lack much-needed medical services and supplies and suffer \na shortage of healthcare specialists. \nIn response to the health needs, the Iraqi Ministry of Health (MoH) needs support to ensure health coverage for all \nvulnerable populations and mitigate the impact of the conflict and COVID-19 on the public health system. The situation \nis currently exacerbated by specific vulnerabilities and challenges related to COVID-19, putting more strain on the people \nand services provided to support them. Health facilities in camps are also stretched with only basic equipment and with \nintensive care units are often a significant distance away, heightening the risk for those experiencing severe symptoms. \nCOVID-19 exacerbated pre-existing vulnerabilities among conflict-affected populations, resulting in increased use of \nnegative coping mechanisms. The situation in Iraq is extremely volatile due to COVID-19 and the political and security \ncontext. The humanitarian community plans for a flexible humanitarian response, adapting to the changing \ncircumstances throughout the year.  \n \nWater, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH): In May 2021, several water treatments plants (WTP) stopped production due \nto decreased water levels. According to the Ministry of Water Resources (MoWR), surface wells with less than 20m \ndepth dried out in most of the governorates in Iraq. The Diyala Government raised a potential need for water trucking to \nhospitals and other critical infrastructure. In many locations, basic services are in a state of decline and there is a growing \nimbalance between water supply and demand. The local communities affected by the drought usually obtain water \nregularly from natural sources, mainly from the rivers and surface wells. Due to the severe drought happening since \nSeptember 2020, the wells are not producing enough water for the families and in many cases, the water resources \nhave dried up. Basra governorate has been adversely affected by increased water salinity, largely bringing crop \nproduction to a halt. The significant decrease in access to natural water sources and the combination with proper \nmethods of purification and storage has put at risk access to drinking water, causing dehydration, impairing hygiene, \nand leading to water-borne diseases such as gastrointestinal diseases, including diarrhea, in many cases related to lack \nof hygiene and improper use of water. In Iraq, the quality of water used for drinking and agriculture is poor and violates \nboth Iraqi National Standards and World Health Organization guidelines. Practices and knowledge of hygiene are limited, \nand it has been observed in the rapid need assessment, a significant increase of acute diarrheal diseases. The main \npriority needs are focused on drinking water supply, safe water storage, and improved hygiene measures, noting that \nseveral communities are lacking access to drinking water due to war damage. \n \nIRCS has chosen the three governorates based on the latest information available from the ministries and \ngovernorates administration, which showed that they had recorded the vast majority of population movements \nassociated with water shortages due to the current drought impact on natural water resources in Ninewa, Diyala, and \nBasra. In three governorates water scarcity, high salinity and pollution levels are some of the major factors. Drought and \nthe related loss of income are pushing many households to move from dry zones to areas with improved water availability \nsuch as cities, a shift that leads to the abandoning of rural areas and worsening of living conditions in urban zones.  \nScaling up WASH interventions is necessary to ensure access to clean water, access to basic sanitation, and improved \nhygiene in the target population. Communities need basic life-sustaining access to WASH services in communities and \nsupport to harness community-based organizations to take actions aimed to improve hygiene practices, soil and water \nmanagement for improved livelihoods and adaptation. As open water sources dry up in many parts of the governorates, \nthe pressure on permanent sources, such as boreholes increases, leading to longer waiting times and the risk of \nbreakdown. There is a decrease in water availability and quality in the livelihood zones due to poor or no recharge of \nwater bodies. Water levels in the rivers and small streams had already reduced significantly by the end of May 2021. \nSo far, no repair of wells and boreholes/handpumps has been undertaken by the IRCS in any governorate. The \nprotracted crisis and the security situation have caused the displacement of people in many parts of the country.  \n \nThere is a need to support communities to take charge of basic hygiene management in their areas and increase \ninterventions in social mobilization and community education on water treatment and storage and effective handwashing \nP a g e  | 13 \n \n \n \n \n \nInternal \nand sanitation practices. Schools are also a key area where WASH services need to be provided, to both retain current \nstudents and to enable children to attend school in a safe and dignified environment and to reduce the risk of \ntransmission. \nHumanitarian agency assessments throughout Iraq, including those of IRCS, consistently demonstrate that the priority \nneeds requested by the affected population (whether in rural areas or IDPs settlements) are food, water, and health \ncare in response to the acute humanitarian needs brought about by years of protracted drought in Iraq. In addition, there \nis a need to ensure that rural livelihoods are supported in the recovery and longer-term phases.  \n \nProtection, gender, and inclusion: In Iraq, the native families have a level of community organization, determined by \none or more community leaders whose responsibility is to lead and make decisions on behalf of the entire community. \nHeads of the household are also male, and women\u2019s representation and decision-making are limited. The affected \ncommunities are culturally diverse and require a differentiated approach in the implementation of activities that considers \nthe needs of the different ethnic groups. This will be worked on through a community engagement and accountability \n(CEA) approach to detect the needs of different social groups, especially women, children, and adolescents. Risk \nassessments will be carried out and coordination mechanisms established to ensure that security and protection \nmeasures are implemented for the affected population and the National Society's volunteers. \n \nTargeting \nUnder this DREF operation, IRCS with the technical assistance of the IFRC Iraq delegation intends to start with \nsupporting the drought-affected population from three governorates: Ninewa, Diyala, and Basra. The total target \npopulation for this operation will be 43,116 people (7,186 households). These three governorates are amongst the \nhotspot governorates affected by the current drought. The rural and hard-to-reach areas in these governorates are \ncurrently not covered by any other actors for food security, health, and WASH programming. IRCS is, therefore, well-\npositioned to carry out its humanitarian intervention and provide food security assistance to those in need in these areas. \nIn addition, considering the amount allocated from DREF, focusing on just three governorates will allow more households \nper province to be covered rather than spreading out across a larger geographical area. This approach will also assure \noperational efficiency, allowing for greater financial resources to be allocated to direct delivery assistance to affected \nhouseholds. \n \nThe targeting process and criteria are designed to include vulnerability and drought-specific indicators. During the initial \nphase, IRCS will prioritize the poorest and poor households with rain-fed lands and whose primary livelihoods means \nare being significantly impacted by the current drought. IRCS, through a community-based targeting approach, will also \nidentify the most vulnerable such as landless labourers who are affected by the drought. Considering the absolute \nvulnerability of the poorest households, IRCS will focus on mitigating the ongoing risk of the use of destructive coping \nstrategies by ensuring minimum food and income security. To ensure no duplication, IRCS regularly participates in the \nInteragency Cash, WASH, and Health coordination working groups during which agencies share information on their \nareas of focus and gaps. \n \nSummary table of geographic targeting: \n \nS.

The selection of people to be assisted will be based on their level of \nvulnerability, including households that have lost their source of livelihoods (loss of crops and animals, etc.), the \nchronically ill, elderly, female-headed households, lactating mothers, and under-five children (malnourished), pregnant \nwomen, and/or people with disabilities, availability, and access to potable water by households in the affected areas. \n \nScenario planning \nThe planned response reflects the current situation and information available at this point of the evolving situation and \nwill be adjusted based on further developments and context changes. This might however change due to the prolonged \ndrought situation. The interventions in this plan have taken into account the risk factors that have been identified. Under \nthis DREF, IRCS intends to provide short-term emergency food assistance, multipurpose cash with WASH, and health \ncare services to the most vulnerable and those pastoral households that are at the greatest risks due to the current dry \nspell. Implementation of the proposed emergency food assistance activities will be a start. \n \nIn addition, IRCS is also planning to conduct a multi-sectoral needs assessment in governorates that are impacted the \nmost by the current dry conditions, to have a clearer understanding of the impacts of a dry spell on agriculture, livelihood \nconditions, and food security amongst the most vulnerable. The findings of the multi-sectoral needs assessment will \nP a g e  | 14 \n \n \n \n \n \nInternal \ninform a full Emergency Appeal that IRCS, in collaboration with the IFRC Iraq delegation, is intending to have for the \nongoing dry spell.

Good \naccess for IRCS is based on wide acceptance from all stakeholders and the organizational structure of IRCS - a high \nnumber of volunteers from affected communities. This high level of access resulted in numerous operations successfully \nfinished or still ongoing in these governorates. More specifically, IRCS has already been supporting the disaster-affected \npeople providing them with humanitarian relief assistance in the target governorates for many years.  \nIn order to mitigate the safety and security risks to organizational staff and volunteers, IFRC and IRCS continue to work \non a clear approach to ensure ongoing community acceptance through engagement with all parties and stakeholders. \nIn addition, clear and appropriate security protocols and procedures have been established in line with the IFRC\u2019s \nMinimum Security Requirements, including with respect to responding to critical incidents, to ensure continued \nengagement and capacity to fulfill all project activity obligations. This approach is supplemented by continued analysis \nof the context. IRCS has dedicated trained security staff regularly who visit IRCS impact areas to provide briefing and \nsupport to field staff to enable them to safely deliver project activities. Timely sharing of security information is ensured \namong all staff. All staff is trained on personal security (Stay Safe and Safer Access) and oriented on RC/RC security \nmanagement systems, and actions in emergencies. IFRC and IRCS staff are trained on culture sensitivity and staff \nrespect to local norms and culture and build positive relationships with community members and beneficiaries.  \n \n- \nIFRC and IRCS will ensure that the design, planning, operations, and implementation of the IRCS programme \nincorporate acceptance as our core approach to gain safe access in the communities in both development and \nemergency humanitarian relief contexts.  \n- \nAll components of IFRC\u2019s Principles and Rules for Red Cross Red Crescent Humanitarian Assistance are fully \nintegrated into the programme design and implementation and adopted by all staff.  \n- \nA community mobilization will be conducted in the target areas by having regular consultancy meetings, gatherings \nwith key influential stakeholders explaining the impartiality, neutrality, and transparency of IFRC and IRCS before \nstarting the programme. \n- \nThe inclusion of a compliant feedback mechanism in the IFRC and IRCS Community Engagement and \nAccountability (CEA) system, allows the beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries to give direct feedback and make \ncomplaints about the delivery of programme interventions.  \n \nB. Operational strategy \n \nOverall operational objective \nThe overall objective is to provide humanitarian food assistance to the financially poor and most vulnerable (7,186 \nhouseholds \u2013 43,116 people) whose primary livelihood means are affected by drought in Ninewa, Diyala, and Basra \nP a g e  | 16 \n \n \n \n \n \nInternal \ngovernorates. IRCS intends to provide emergency food security support, cash assistance, WASH, and health care \nservices to drought-affected households from September 2021 to March 2022. \n \nThe planned humanitarian food security activities will be implemented in two phases. The initial phase, which covers the \nperiod from 1 September to 31 October 2021, will be providing life-saving assistance to address the immediate food \nneeds of the most vulnerable households affected by the drought. During the initial phase, IRCS will also conduct a \nmulti-sectoral needs assessment in drought-affected governorates to seek an in-depth understanding of the impacts of \ndrought on food security and the livelihoods of the households. In addition to the three targeted governorates, IRCS will \nexpand the geographical target for the multi-sectoral needs assessment. The list of governorates for this assessment \nwill be finalized in coordination and consultation with Government ministries and departments, Food Security Cluster, \nand other humanitarian actors who will also plan to have food security and livelihood programmes for drought-affected \npopulations. The findings of the multi-sectoral needs assessment will also support IRCS to understand what types of \nlivelihood restoration, WASH, health, migration, and PGI interventions are most suitable and sustainable for the affected \npopulation.  \n \nThere are high possibilities that this DREF operation will scale up into an Emergency Appeal based on the revised EPOA \nguided by multi-sectoral needs assessment in the coming months. At the end of the initial phase, when emergency food \nassistance is distributed and a multi-sectoral needs assessment is conducted, IRCS with IFRC support plans to launch \nan Emergency Appeal and will request the second funding allocation to implement livelihood restoration activities as \noutlined in the second specific objective. \n \nBased on the overall response strategy, this DREF will provide funding to the procurement of food parcels, conduct a \nmulti-sectoral needs assessment in drought-affected governorates, and overall operational support to IRCS for effective \nand efficient drought response.  \n \nOperational support services \n \nHuman Resources \nAs part of the implementation of this DREF, the IFRC and IRCS will mobilize the following resources: \n \nIFRC: \n- \nThe Head of the IFRC Iraq delegation will be ultimately accountable for timely implementation, compliance, \nfinancial management, and reporting of the operation. \n- \nDuring the operation, IFRC will continue the technical support to IRCS through its staff from the Iraq delegation \nwith the Disaster Risk Management (DRM) Delegates and MENA team.  \n- \nThe IFRC Iraq delegation/MENA will provide technical support through its logistics, procurement, finance, and \nadmin departments. \n \nIRCS: \n- \nAt the governorates, the National Society will mobilize a branch staff designated for the implementation of the \nDREF operation activities. \n- \nThe National Society will engage the trained NRTs to implement and supervise the DREF operation with \nvolunteers in target areas.  \n \nLogistics and Procurement: \nThe acquisition of the goods and services will be done according to the IRCS procedures, aligned with IFRC standards, \nin close coordination with IFRC Secretariat\u2019s Global Humanitarian Services & Supply Chain Management (GHS & SCM) \nand utilizing if required IFRC GHS & SCM structures and existing regional arrangements. The IFRC GHS & SCM \nDepartment in Beirut will continue to provide technical support as required by the National Society for all the \nprocurement. GHS & SCM will also provide technical validation (quality assurance) of the procurement process \naccording to the IFRC established rules and regulations. All project files exceeding CHF threshold of 50,000 are subject \nto technical validation, whereby for CVA activities service procurement technical approval must be sought from the \nrelevant regional GHS & SCM as follows: for Commodity vouchers \u2013 based on the value of goods and fees to be charged \nby Suppliers; for Value vouchers \u2013 based on the value of Service fees to be charged by Suppliers; for Third-party cash \ndistribution- based on the value of Service fees to be charged by Suppliers, irrespective of the value of service fees, \nprocurement technical approval must be sought from the relevant regional GHS & SCM. \n \nCommunication and visibility \nTo support volunteers for operation as well as the visibility of RCRC actions on the ground, IRCS will provide its \nvolunteers with protection and visibility material from their existing stock. IRCS and IFRC will collaborate to implement \na communication strategy that will support the positioning of IRCS as a credible humanitarian responder with a network \nof volunteers and expertise in disaster management and unique access to people in need: \nP a g e  | 17 \n \n \n \n \n \nInternal \n \n- \nmanage reputational risks; \n- \nprovide accountability to donors on the impact of the Red Cross Red Crescent response; \n- \nmaximize opportunities to build IRCS communications capacity;  \n \nThe audiences are the news media, social media audiences, Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, partners, peer \norganizations, and donors. Materials will be developed and shared, including high-quality photos, videos, stories, key \nmessages to guide partner communications and social media posts. Spokespeople will be identified, supported, and \npitched to the media. Coverage will be monitored. Where possible, journalists and others will be supported to visit Red \nCrescent activities.  \n \nAll communications products will preserve the dignity of people and promote diversity, gender inclusion, and respect.  \n \nIFRC will support the IRCS communications team to communicate with external audiences with a focus on the drought \nand the Red Cross and Red Crescent humanitarian actions assisting the affected people. The communications will \ngenerate visibility and support for the humanitarian needs and the Red Cross Red Crescent response. Close \ncollaboration will be maintained between the MENA regional communications unit, IFRC Country Delegation, and the \nNational Society to ensure a coherent and coordinated communications approach. Communications content will be \npromoted on national, regional, and global IFRC channels and shared with National Societies in the IFRC network. \nMedia and social media scanning will aim to increase effectiveness and contribute to assessing and managing risks. \n \nPlanning, monitoring, evaluation, and reporting (PMER) \nThe IRCS with the support of the IFRC country delegation and regional office will lead on reporting, monitoring, and \nevaluation of this operation. Reporting on the operation will be carried out in accordance with the IFRC DREF reporting \nstandards. Regular updates will be issued during the operation\u2019s timeframe with a final report issued within three months \nafter the end of the operation.   \n \nTechnical PMER capacity and technical support will be provided through IFRC MENA Regional office PMER team and \nthe IFRC country delegation. This will help identify and, where possible and necessary, resolve any issues. An end-of-\noperation lessons learned exercise will take place to capture the relevance, efficiency, and effectiveness of the \noperation. It will also be used to measure qualitative outcome indicators and to ensure that the best practices are \ncaptured to inform the planning and designing of the long-term projects towards improved ways of working and \nincreasing effectiveness and efficiency to the communities.  \n \nThe IRCS has progressively innovated, streamlined, and enriched its PMER system, with the support of the IFRC, to \nimprove the quality of any emergency operation delivery. In addition to regular monitoring and evaluation, the PMER \nsystem of IRCS promotes accountability by ensuring access of target communities to detailed information on the quality \nstandards of operation activities. IRCS implements the Community Engagement and Accountability approach in its all-\nhumanitarian programme which ensures the participation of project beneficiaries and wider communities in programme. \n \nCommunity Engagement and Accountability \nGuided by the IFRC CEA guide, the project approach will also integrate CEA minimum actions that help ensuring the \ncommunity is an integral part of the whole appeal, by integrating communication and participation throughout the \nprogram cycle. Starting from the needs assessment, community perceptions had been captured to support the design \nof a relevant appeal related to the impact of drought on Iraq. The IFRC CEA unit at the regional office will be working \nclosely with the technical sectors (Health, WASH, Protection, and livelihoods), the IFRC country office, and the partner \nnational societies who supports PMER and CEA operational efforts of IRCS to backup IRCS in the necessary CEA \nrelated work that may include the provision of technical support in setting or scaling up feedback mechanisms including \nat least one language-appropriate Feedback channel to ensure a community-centred approach to the design and \ndelivery of the project. Satisfaction surveys will be conducted either as stand-alone or as part of the regular monitoring \nto ensure that solicited feedback is being captured throughout the implementation and to ensure course correction on \nactivities once required. The IFRC together with IRCS will capture best practices and lessons learned in CEA to further \nimprove IRCS capacities through this appeal and integrate best practices and learnings in other projects in the future. \n \nAdministration and Finance \nA Project Grant Agreement will be signed between the IFRC Iraq delegation and the IRCS. The operation will rely on \nexisting financial management and administration systems in IRCS and IFRC. The IFRC, through the finance \ndepartment, provides the necessary operational support for review, validation of budgets, bank transfers, and technical \nassistance to the National Society on procedures for justification of expenditures, including the review and validation of \ninvoices.\nP a g e  | 18 \n \n \n \n \n \nInternal \nC. Detailed Operational Plan \n \n \nLivelihoods and basic needs \nPeople targeted: 36,000 \nMale: 18,072 \nFemale: 17,928 \nRequirements (CHF): 287,669  \nNeeds analysis: The drought-affected population in Iraq, mostly rural community livelihoods, particularly small-scale agricultural producers, whose limited production \nnegatively impacted their access and the availability of resources to cover their basic needs. The quick overview by the UNFAO revealed that drought hampered affected \npeople\u2019s ability, these complex disasters also increased the need of affected people including WASH, health, and food needs. In many drought-affected governorates, the \npopulation does not have the necessary resources to purchase farm supplies, which affected their ability to earn a living. Households and communities need support to recover \ntheir livelihoods with dignity. According to the KRI government, ministry of agriculture and UNFAO report for 2021 for drought in the country the most pressing humanitarian \nneeds in 2021 are: (i) immediate access to food and nutrition; (ii) WASH; and (iii) health and rural livelihood support to restore own food access and prevent displacement. In \norder to assess the drought impact across the governorates in-country, FAO participated in a rapid assessment in June 2021. The rapid assessments showed a progressively \ndeteriorating situation with 4.1 million people now facing severe food insecurity and in need of urgent action. Iraq is experiencing a major livelihood crisis - primarily caused by \nsevere drought, which limits food production and depletes farmers\u2019 and livestock keepers\u2019 assets and livelihoods. Years of civil conflict and instability as well as the severely \ndegraded condition of much of the land have compounded the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and now drought is leading to the food security crisis we are witnessing \ntoday. \n \nThe current intervention in the provision of food parcels (4,500 HHs) and cash assistance (1,500 HHs) is only able to cover the needs for a month, continuously monitoring on \nthe food security situation will be conducted with close coordination with local government, Cash Working Group and other humanitarian actors in-country who are also providing \nfood and Cash and Vouchers assistance. Additional assistance might be considered and provided based on the situation and multi-sectoral needs assessment.  \n \nRisk analysis: The drought emergency intensifies, and communities are taking negative coping strategies. The country\u2019s population relies on the natural resource base to \nmeet daily needs, but serious environmental issues such as desertification, climate change, aquifer depletion, ecosystem degradation, biodiversity loss, and pollution all \nnegatively impact the resilience of the rural livelihoods that form the country\u2019s foundation.  \n \nPopulation to be assisted: Food and livelihoods assistance will be provided to 6,000 HHs (food parcels: 4,500 HHs and cash assistance: 1,500) drought-affected families \n(36,000 people) in Ninewa, Diyala, and Basra where a critical gap has been identified by the IRCS initial assessment and Food Security Cluster.   \n \nProgramme standards/benchmarks: IFRC country delegation will engage the MENA CVA coordinator for technical support to ensure smooth implementation of the cash \ninterventions. IFRC will also support the IRCS to ensure effective participation of affected communities and accountability throughout the project cycle by setting up feedback \nand complaints platforms as guided by the IFRC community engagement and accountability (CEA) standards and Core Humanitarian Standards (CHS). The guidelines from \nthe cash working group as well as the IFRC Cash in emergency toolkit will be instrumental as a reference during implementation. \nP a g e  | 19 \n \n \n \n \n \nInternal \nP&B \nOutput \nCode \nLivelihoods and basic needs Outcome 1: Communities, especially in disaster and crisis-\naffected areas, restore and strengthen their livelihoods \n# of households that have enough food, cash or income to \nmeet their survival threshold (Target: 6,000)  \nLivelihoods and basic needs Output 1.2: Basic needs assistance for livelihoods security \nincluding food is provided to the most affected communities \n# of households reached with food assistance for (basic \nneeds) (Target: 4,500) \nActivities planned \nMonth \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAP008 \nIdentification, registration, and verification of people to be \nassisted  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nAP008 \nProcurement of food package \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAP008 \nDistribution of food package among 4,500 households  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nAP008 \nPost distribution monitoring, including regular measurement of \nFood Security indicators  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nP&B \nOutput \nCode \nLivelihoods and basic needs Output 1.5: Households are provided with \nunconditional/multipurpose cash grants to address their basic needs \n# of households reached with multipurpose cash \nassistance for (basic needs) (Target: 1,500) \nActivities planned \nMonth \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAP081 \nIdentification, registration, verification, and orientation of people \nto be provided with cash assistance \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAP081 \nPreparation of baseline assessment for Cash Voucher \nAssistance (CVA)  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAP081 \nOrientation on the selection of people to be assisted and use of \nmobile money transfer system for the target population \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAP081 \nDistribution of multipurpose cash assistance to 1,500 \nhouseholds (USD 100)  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAP081 \nEstablishment of the CEA activities such as setting up targeting \ncommittees as well as feedback and complaints mechanism \nand training of volunteers/beneficiary satisfaction survey \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAP081 \nConduct post-distribution monitoring \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAP081 \nConsultation with financial service providers in the country \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nP a g e  | 20 \n \n \n \n \n \nInternal \n \n \nHealth \nPeople targeted: 40,780  \nMale: 20,472 \nFemale: 20,308 \nRequirements (CHF): 158,336 \nNeeds analysis: In drought-affected governorates, local communities are facing the issues of water shortage, existing water sources, and dry agricultural land.

IRCS will therefore ensure \nthat female staff and volunteers are part of the assessment, relief distribution teams so that women and girls are included in the response activities. In addition to the physical \nsafety risks to civilians living in conflict and drought-affected areas and the increasing pressures facing those living in displacement, people have had to endure significant \ninterruptions to vital services as a result of the closure of IDPs camps in many parts of the country. Stronger linkages with protection clusters are also sought on relevant \nissues of common interest, such as the development of a comprehensive disability and survivor support strategy and response; enhanced operational and planning integration \naround protection, and GBV prevention and response. IRCS and IFRC will coordinate with protection and gender-based violence clusters in governorates.

Situation analysis \n \nDescription of the disaster  \n \nThe effect of the drought is on a worsening trend in all \nthe country affecting at a different level the North, East \nand South regions mainly Tigray, Afar, Harari, \nSouthern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region \n(SNNPR) regions Somali and Oromia regions. The \nmost severely impacted regions are the lowland areas \nof southern and eastern Oromia and Somali regions \nespecially the Arid and Semi-Arid (ASAL) region of \nSomali and parts of Oromia and SNNPR are \nexperiencing a deterioration of the situation. The \ndrought prevalence is a result of the two main rainy \nseasons Ganna/GU rains (March-May) and the short \nrainy season (Hagayya/\u2018Dyre\u2019) (October-November), \nwhich has been erratic and characterized by late \nonsets, below-average cumulative quantities, and poor \ndistribution both in time and space in the Somali region \n(southern and eastern Somali region (6 zones)), \n@ FEWS NET: Projected food security outcomes, February 2022 to May 2022 \nEmergency Plan of Action (EPoA) \nEthiopia : Drought emergency in south \nregions \nP a g e  | 2 \n \n \n \n \n \nPublic \nsouthern Oromia region (4 zones ) and SNNPR region (1 zone). Given the forecast for a poor March to May 2022 \nGu/Gana season, The Famine Early Warning Systems (FEWSNET) predicts widespread Crisis (IPC Phase 3) \noutcomes, with worst-drought affected areas likely to face Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes starting late February \n2022. \nThe impacts of drought are already visible, with diminishing pasture and water. Atypical livestock deaths increase water \nstress and looming hunger in the Borana Zone of Oromia region and six zones of the Somali region.  \n                                                                                                                                 \nThe most recent effect of the drought is migration and displacement of both humans and livestock northwards due to \nreduced pasture and water scarcity. Often 200km or 300km northwards with an everyday additional pressure on host \ncommunity\u2019s livelihood also. Social tensions cannot be ruled out as one of the origins and also the effect of migration. \nAn increase in malnutrition levels and related opportunistic diseases among children under five, lactating and pregnant \nwomen are already being felt and may increase further if quick action is not taken.  \nUNOCHA estimates more than 6.4 million people require food assistance in 2022 across all drought-affected areas1, \nincluding 3 million people in Somali Region, 2.4 million in eastern Oromia and 1 million people in southern Oromia. Apart \nfrom the drought, the food security situation of affected populations is further compounded by the COVID19 pandemic \nand persisting locust pests. It should be noted that drought is one of the key factors of the food crisis in the country when \nin the North the Tigray conflict has worsened the situation which is impacting other regions already affected by the \ndrought such as Afar and Oromia as an example. There is a global risk of Famine declaration in the country in the most \naffected localities among the North and South regions. IFRC is implementing an emergency appeal operation covering \nthe complex situation and consequences of the Tigray crisis when in the South, drought is still worsening the needs.  \n \nDrought as a climate challenge is linked to all the other humanitarian challenges raised above and appear like a slow \nonset becoming a high risk to felt on additional humanitarian emergencies in the affected localities and over. The \nEthiopian government through the regional authorities has requested ERCS to support the scale-up of the ongoing \nresponse since the population and needs are alarmingly increasing surpassing the current capacities. Refer to link of \nthe letter dated 10th February 2021: DRMB Letter to ERCS.pdf.  \n \nFor the details of the government of Somali region response plan, please see: Somali Region Drought Response Plan- \nDec 2021 (1) (1).pdf \n \nSummary of the current response  \n \nERCS has a responsibility to provide humanitarian assistance to populations affected by disasters, as enshrined in the \namended charter revised on 26 January 2018 for assisting people affected by natural disasters and conflict throughout \nthe country. The main auxiliary role of ERCS is to supplement the government in the fulfilment of its responsibility to \naddress the vulnerabilities that exist in the country. The Geneva Convention and additional protocol and the International \nHumanitarian Law are other legal bases for Red Cross engagement in such kind of humanitarian interventions being \nimpartial, neutral and independent as outlined in its Fundamental Principles. ERCS is a key national humanitarian actor \nand is present in all the regions of Ethiopia through its network of branches and 44,138 volunteers, including 215 staff \nand volunteers trained in CVA. 5 million members and 6,000 Red Cross committees at the community level. ERCS has \nrepresentation by regional and zonal branches for a total of 11 regions and 37 branches.  \n \nAt the National Headquarters (NHQ), through the Deputy Secretary-General (DGF) for programs, operations are led by \na competent technical team in the disaster preparedness and response department. ERCS has 16 trained National \nDisaster Response Teams (NDRTs) and 229 Branch Disaster Response Teams (BDRTs). ERCS` auxiliary status \nensures that ERCS can move faster and reach areas that are relatively sensitive and where other humanitarian actors \ncannot easily access. ERCS has been privileged by its local network and acceptance by communities and has not been \nlimited in terms of access across the entirety of affected regions Ethiopia. \n \nERCS has the structural, skills and systemic capacities to implement the proposed food security DREF operation with \nthe support of IFRC. ERCS, in the past two years, has successfully implemented/implemented in collaboration with IFR \nthree Emergency Appeals: COVID-19, Tigray Crisis  Population Movement Complex Emergency, and Locust invasion \nand three DREF operations (Civil unrest in Oromia, Floods in Amhara South, Election Preparedness and food security \nin Amhara). It is recently one of the approved pilot countries for the Early Action Protocol (EAP) for floods. Moreover, \nERCS is one of the first National Societies to be validated for Working With Project Partners (WWPP) funds transfer \nfunding mechanism after rigorous assessments and capacity development by IFRC and reportedly one of the most \nsuccessful in the application of the modality.  \n \n1 https://reliefweb.int/report/ethiopia/ethiopia-humanitarian-bulletin-3-january-2022  \nP a g e  | 3 \n \n \n \n \n \nPublic \n \nERCS maintains equal, independent, and neutral responsibility to reach all in needs in all parts of the country; and has \nbeen called upon in its position as an auxiliary by its Government to scale up in collaboration with other Movement \npartners its immediate support to communities experiencing food insecurity across Ethiopia.  \n \nThe table below presents the initial responses and achievements of ERCS so far before: \n \nRegions \nResponse given  \nNo. of beneficiaries \nreached \nPartner  \nSomali region Jigjig \nzone  \n300 quintals of wheat \nflour and 2,000 litres of \noil \n2,000 people \nERCS \nSomali region and \nOromia region Moyale \n200 quintal wheat flour \nand 1,332 litres of oil \ndistributed \n1,332 \nERCS HQ and Ormia region and Farma \nAfrica \nSomali Region Moyale   \nand Oromia Region \nMoyale \n200 quintal wheat flour \nand 1,332 litres of oil \ndistributed \n1,332  \nERCS HQ and Ormia region and Farma \nAfrica \nOromia region, Borena \nzone \n398 quintal wheat flour \nand 2,655 litres of oil \ndistributed \n2,655 people \nERCS HQ and Oromia region \nOromia region, Dawe \nSerer, Bale \n90 quintal food \n600 people \nERCS and Coalition for Humanity \nSomali and Oromia \nMoyale \nFodder distributed \n600 people \nSwiss Red Cross \nSomali and Oromia \nMoyale \nPurchase \nof \n500 \nquintals of wheat flour \nand 3,335 litres of oil \non process \n3,335 people \nERCS HQ and Moyale branch \nOromia region, \nMedawelabu and Dello \nworedas of Bale \n250 quintals of wheat \nflour and 1,668 litres of \noil \n1,668 people \nERCS HQ and Oromia region branch \n \n \nOverview of Red Cross Red Crescent Movement Actions in-country \n \nIFRC has a cluster delegation presence in Ethiopia which also covers Djibouti which is also adequately supported by \nthe African Region office in Nairobi. The delegation has technical staffing including the Operations manager and PMER \nofficer while it also supports key functions in the National society staffing establishment including the Operations officer, \nPGI coordinator and finance officer. \n \nICRC has a delegation in Addis Abeba and 5 Sub-Delegations (Mekelle, Shire, Nekemte, Jigjiga, Gondar). In addition \nto its specific operations, it supports ERCS in different regions of the country through its annual Cooperation Programme. \nIn response to the drought, ICRC has complemented its livestock vaccination programme with the provision of animal \nfeed for 20,000 vulnerable households affected by the drought. \n \nThere are a significant number of Partners National Societies (PNS) in Ethiopia who also support different projects in \nthe country, including cash preparedness, as well as emergency operations including the Federation wide Ethiopia crisis \nappeal led by IFRC. The in-country PNSs include the Swiss Red Cross, Danish Red Cross, Netherlands Red Cross, \nAustrian Red Cross, German Red Cross, Finish Red Cross and Italian Red Cross. The Canadian and the British Red \nCross are remote active patters to ERCS in the Ethiopia humanitarian movement operation.  \n \nThe Red Cross and Red Crescent (RCRC) Movement have a robust Strengthening Movement Coordination and \nCooperation (SMCC) mechanism and through its operation pillar has an active Emergency operation coordination forum. \nThis forum activated a movement response task team from 1st of February 2022, comprising of technical delegates \nfrom IFRC, Swiss Red Cross, German Red Cross, Netherlands Red Cross and led by ERCS director of \nPrograms/operations. The task team have since then dispatched three teams to carry out a comprehensive assessment \nin three affected regions of Somali and parts of Oromia and SNNPR. The team, as part of its elaborate term of reference, \nwill support ERCS in developing a movement response plan after the assessment. That plan will coordinate and support \nresource mobilization for the response, including the request for a DREF allocation through this plan of action. \n \nP a g e  | 4 \n \n \n \n \n \nPublic \nOverview of non-RCRC actors\u2019 actions in the country \n \nERCS coordinates with the National Disaster Risk Management Commission (NDRMC) in the planning and \nimplementation of emergency response actions; and is a member of the National Operations Centre. ERCS is also part \nof the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT), it is represented in clusters and participates in inter-agency working group \nmeetings for various sectors (Cash, Food Security, Nutrition, ES/NFI, Protection, and Education) NHQ and regional \nlevels, as well as the NDRMC, led national early warning task force and Cash Working Group. Movement Partner focal \npoints are supporting ERCS with engagement in the cluster system. The IFRC Ethiopia and Ethiopia CCD is supporting \nthe Food and Non-Food Security, ES/NFI clusters, and are active members of the National Cash Working Group. \n \nThe humanitarian country team structure in Ethiopia is active with all structures fully engaged because of the protracted \nmulti-hazard crisis in the country in the last few years. UNOCHA and the Government through the NDRM department \nare the lead in the coordination.  \nMultiple numbers international organizations are active in the response to the drought. The coordination by the regional \ngovernment is very robust, all clusters are activated, and their regional government has developed a drought response \nplan mentioned in the first section which also forms the basis of this DREF.  \nFurther assessment will update more on the catalogue of specific engagement of respective organizations in the Region \nand on the active field response in the targeted region.  \n \nNeeds analysis, targeting, scenario planning and risk assessment \n \nNeeds analysis  \nReference to triangulated sources of assessment including the Movement multi-sectoral assessment, Somali Regional \nresponse plan based on the regional level inter-agency assessments, early warning and projection indicators of FEWS \nNET (February to May 2022) and OCHA. update bulletins of the country humanitarian situation of the country, have all \nindicated that the drought is alarming, scaling and ravaging increasing vulnerabilities among the pastoral communities \nin the affected arid climate zone of Ethiopia, Somali region being worst affected by geographical and demographic \nscope.  \nFEWS NET (February-May 2022) projection indicates that the drought-affected Somali and Parts Oromia region will \nprogress to IPC 4 from February a reality being confirmed now (FEWS NET Ethiopia Food Security Outlook 21 to May \n22_Final.pdf). Moreover, UNOCHA (Ethiopia Humanitarian bulletin, 3rd January 2022) postulates that more than 6.4 \nmillion people are estimated to require food assistance in 2022 across all drought-affected areas, including 3 million \npeople in Somali Region, 2.4 million in eastern Oromia and 1 million people in southern Oromia. \n  \nThe worsening trends include deteriorating vegetative conditions, increased distances to water sources, worsening \nlivestock conditions, diminishing productivity of livestock products and low stock prices. At worst post parts of the Somali \nzone, the stock is dying especially goats and cattle with the camels looking weak and exhausted too. The condition is \ncompromising people\u2019s life due to induced food security crisis which makes the affected population susceptible to risks \nof nutritionally related diseases and even death especially among children under five, lactating and pregnant mothers \nand the elderly.    \n \nSummary of ERCs assessment in Somali region : \n\u2022 \n>3 Million people in need, 900,000 people receive daily support through different sectors  \n\u2022 \nMalnutrition: from 813,000 screened 14,000 (1,72%) are SAM and 137,000 (16.8%) are MAM, 32% of pregnant \nand lactating women are moderately malnourished (72,000 women) \n\u2022 \nWASH: 2.28 Million people in 657 sites across 86 woredas require emergency water interventions \n\u2022 \nLivelihood: 683,000 livestock deaths have been reported already \n\u2022 \nIDP\u2019s: 146,297 households are displaced in Somali Region spread over 427 sites - latest info from August 2021 \n(DTM27. Refer to detailed ERCS assessment in Somali region Briefing drought assessment Somali Region.pdf). \n \nKey Basic needs sectors are analysed to guide the response strategy of this DREF based on the information and data \navailable from the different instruments aforementioned  \nFood and livelihood needs  \nThe assessments indicated that food is the priority need. FEWS NET focused indicator of February to May 2022 places \nmost of the region in IPC4. Household food access is expected to remain constrained as staple food prices remain \nabove average and livestock prices are relatively low. As a result, critical nutrition outcomes will persist in children under \nfive years of age. Households are also likely to increase consumption-based coping strategies like reducing the number \nof daily meals, eating less preferred foods, limiting adult intake for children to eat, borrowing food from friends and \nrelatives and sale of more livestock than normal. The current regional response plan appeal for immediate food relief \nP a g e  | 5 \n \n \n \n \n \nPublic \nfor 628,744 persons a number that is progressively increasing as the drought scales up and more populations drop from \nthe pastoral livelihood.  \nThe lack of pasture for the livestock, which is the main livelihood of the affected pastoral communities, is resulting in \nemaciated body condition of the animals, exhaustion, and eventual death. Those with large stock are making all effort \nto sustain their stock including the desperate cooping option of migration which also due to the long stretch is increasing \nexhaustion level of weak animals to succumb. Others with small stock are trying to feed their livestock sometimes \nsharing with them what the family had for domestic sustenance. This is another desperate undertaking that also \ncompromises the family\u2019s nutrition. \nIn the practical observation of such needs, provision of livestock feeds for the milking lactating stock in the villages can \nbe an expensive undertaking but ideal to save the stock and increase milk production to contribute to the children's \nnutrition requirement which is now depriving them by feeding with them. In the alternative, home stock feeding initiative, \nthe children are also tasked to do a collection of food remains and grass in the forest and any hidden under the woods. \nThis is another child labouring at the expense of school which also increases their exhaustion and malnutrition levels.     \nWater Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) needs: \nFailure of the two rainy seasons has resulted in extreme water shortage, migration of pastoral communities and \nwidespread reliance on water trucking. High-water prices have been reported in most pastoral and agro-pastoral \nlivelihood zones. With the movement of livestock to strategic water points and limited access to productive land for \nfarming and grazing, there is already increasing local tensions which could trigger further inter-communal conflict as a \nresult of inward migration and survival competition thereof for pasture and water. The cost of water has increased in \nsome areas by 60 % during the critical drought period. There is an increase in distance to household water sources \nbecause of the drying water sources. \nThe regional inter-agency assessment report states that a population of 2,279,609 people have constrained access to \nwater and need water trucking intervention in 657 sites across 86 woredas in the Somali region. Water needs are also \nimpacting community services, including health facilities, leading to closures which further exacerbates the wellbeing of \nthe affected population.    \nThe few sustainable water sources are under pressure with huge human population and livestock population due to the \ninward migration when the sub-surface water sources are depleted. This result in increased running hours of the \nborehole pumps, hence frequent breakdowns and high cost of maintenance. There is need to support and \nmaintain/sustain the operation of these lifeline water sources. \nThe table below captured from the Somali region assessment from Regional interagency Assessment reflects the level \nof water stress with half of the water sources not functional: \n \n \nHealth and Nutrition needs:  \nThe drought had a direct effect on the health sector, with some facilities completely closed due to lack of water and \nmigration of the population in search of water and pasture for their livestock as cited by the regional seasonal \nP a g e  | 6 \n \n \n \n \n \nPublic \nassessment. Water scarcity increases the risk of susceptibility of water and hygiene borne diseases like cholera, acute \nwatery diarrhoea, scabies, etc.  \nMalnutrition related ailments is another hazard as a result of the drought due to the low nutritional level. The drivers of \nacute malnutrition include reduced livestock productivity, reduced milk consumption, poor infant and young child feeding \npractices, poor hygiene and sanitation, stock-outs for essential commodities for the management of acute malnutrition \nand other morbidities.  \nA nutritional screening conducted by the Regional Health Bureau across Somali Region in December 2021 revealed a \nproxy Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) rate of 18 per cent, higher than the global threshold of 15 per cent. Some \n225,000 malnourished children and over 100,000 pregnant and breastfeeding women in Somali and Oromia currently \nneed nutrition support according to UNICEF2.  \n \nProtection needs \nWomen and girls in areas affected by drought face the risk of multiple forms of gender-based violence (GBV), including \nsexual violence, intimate partner violence and forced marriages. Other vulnerable groups include people living with HIV, \npeople living with disabilities, children under five, pregnant and lactating mothers among others. The emergency has \nalso placed an additional burden on women in terms of responsibilities around household food consumption, water \ncollection and household care responsibilities, which expose them to greater risks. \nA recent assessment by ERCS has revealed that women track long distances for water and wait more than 8 hours in \nwater points due to congestion, the assessment further noted that after this stressful day some collapsed on the way \ndue to hunger and fatigue.  \nOlder men and women have to cover greater distances to find food, firewood and water for themselves and their \nfamilies. With entire communities affected, traditional support networks are unable to cope. Older people are left isolated \nand in need, causing great emotional distress. \n \nTargeting \n \nIn terms of geographical targeting, this DREF operation will target the Somali region and Oromia (Moyale and Boran \nzones). The specific location will be determined by the Branch in consultation with the regional government and other \nhumanitarian actors in the regional level coordination forum. A total of 50,0000 people of the most vulnerable households \nwill be assisted in the multisectoral support, including 3000HH (15,000 people )  targeted with multipurpose cash \nassistance. \n \nPriority will be given to support economically vulnerable households (living under MEB) who are most affected by the \ndrought with no alternative coping strategies, as guided by standard humanitarian practices and any other localised \ncommunity standards and within customs - with specific consideration within this group for: \n  \ni) \nHouseholds with either pregnant and lactating mothers and/or under-five children, \nii) Household with nursing aged persons, and/or persons terminally ill with HIV/AIDS or other similar diseases, \niii) Households that contain orphans, elderly people, people with disabilities, \niv) Household with single mothers or are child-headed \nv) Households with social protection needs.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2 Ethiopia_ Drought Update No. 1, January 2022 - Ethiopia _ ReliefWeb.html \n \nP a g e  | 7 \n \n \n \n \n \nPublic \n \nEstimated disaggregated data for population targeted. \n \nCategory \nEstimated % \nof target group \n% female \n% male \nYoung Children (under 5 years) \n30% \n13% \n12% \nChildren (5-17yrs) \n20% \n11% \n9% \nAdults (18-49 yrs) \n45% \n35% \n10% \nElderly (>50 yrs) \n10% \n6% \n4% \nTotal \n100% \n55% \n45% \nPeople with disabilities \n12% \nunknown \nunknown \n \n \n \nScenario planning  \n \nScenario \nHumanitarian consequence \nPotential Response \nScenario \n1: \nFood \nsecurity \nshocks \nare \nbeyond \ncommunity \nmeans \nand \nstressed \nwater access levels \n\u2022 \nTarget areas receive below-average \nrainfall - with low crop yield and reduced \npasture regeneration. \n Longer dry spells  \n\u2022 \nHigh food prices in the local markets  \n\u2022 \n Increased cases of malnutrition among \nthe affected population \n\u2022 \n Increase in water shortage  \n\u2022 \nStressed phase classification  \n\u2022 \nare in IPC 3. \n\u2022 \nGovernment and Somali regional actors \nare providing initial response  \n\u2022 \nMonitor the rains and support WASH and \nlivelihood initiatives.

The target Somali region shares a border with the Oromo and Afar Regions and internally with Kenya, Somalia \nand Djibouti. The pastoral communities\u2019 migratory trends in search of pasture and water make them cross borders in \nwhich case there is often resource-based ethnic conflict with neighbours. In the long stretch Somalia border risk \ninfiltration of AL-Shabab, armed militant group although the government security apparatus is aware, vigilant and in \ncontrol. \nOromia Region \nProtests and demonstrations occur periodically in a range of towns across the Oromia region. Towns in the Wollega and \nShewa Zones, and West Arsi Zone, including Ambo, Wolissa, Nekemte and Shashemene, have been particularly \naffected. Demonstrations have also been witnessed elsewhere including in the Bale Zone to the south-east. Some \nprotests have turned violent and resulted in casualties; others caused severe disruption to road travel including major \nroads to and from Addis Ababa. There is a threat of kidnapping in western areas of Oromia, particularly West Wollega, \nEast Wollega and Qellem Wollega Zones. Recent kidnaps have targeted the mining industry. Towns in the Wollega and \nShewa Zones, and West Arsi Zone, including Ambo, Wolissa, Nekemte and Shashemene, have been particularly \naffected.  \nSouthern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region (SNNPR) \nThere have been some instances of civil unrest in towns in the Sidama Zone, including Hawassa, and clashes along \nstretches of the internal border with the Oromia region, especially in the Gedeo Zone. Whilst such disturbances have \nbeen less frequent than in several other areas of Ethiopia, a number have turned violent at short notice. \nSomali Region \nThere is local instability, lawlessness, military activity, and general risk of banditry in the Somali Region. Since the mid-\n1990s, insurgent groups, some affiliated with militant organizations, have clashed with government forces. There have \nalso been attacks on staff working for international NGOs. \n \nMoreover, ERCS has invested heavily in security including technical capacities and Standard Operating Procedures \n(SOPs).  In addition, due diligence for the safety of staff will be taken utmost and the following specific actions will be \npart of the routine:  \n\u2022 \nCommunity engagement and conflict-sensitive approach strengthened through observance of Red Cross \nmovement fundamental principles, and   \n\u2022 \nThe community feedback data can also be monitored regularly for comments that may indicate a threat to \nstaff and volunteers and relayed to security focal points \n\u2022 \nRespect of visibility through the wearing of jackets and regular communication on all the movements. \n\u2022 \nRegular briefings will be organized to remind volunteers and staff of their behaviour and Safer Access. \n\u2022 \nCoordination will be maintained between the ERCS and IFRC to ensure that all security measures are \nrespected. \n\u2022 \nCarry out periodic and need-based security assessments to inform the security strategies. \n\u2022 \nConstant communication check-in measures with base by all operation staff will be sustained and \ncommunication to communities around the objectives of this assistance. \n\u2022 \nImplement the ERCS CVA risk analysis and mitigation measures, especially around the safety of affected \npopulations \n \n \nCOVID-19 pandemic: This operation and its operational strategy consider the risks related to the current COVID-19 \npandemic and is aligned with the IFRC Global COVID-19 Emergency Appeal that supports National Societies to deliver \nassistance and support to communities affected or at risk of being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to \nthe Ministry of Health of Ethiopia as of 5th December  of February 2022, a total of 466,455 COVID 19 cases had been \nregistered with 400,734 recoveries and  7,356 deaths in total lab tests of 4,382,926  persons  in Ethiopia with a total \nvaccinated of  9,372,107 \nTo date, the following measures have been taken to curb the spread of the disease: mandatory mask-wearing, \nhandwashing stations, using soap and water or alcohol hand rubs, setting up of COVID-19 screening sites, setting up \nof testing and treatment centres; advocating with available risk communication resources, providing updated information \nregularly on the evolving COVID-19 situation. ERCS responses to COVID-19 are supported through the IFRC Global \nP a g e  | 9 \n \n \n \n \n \nPublic \nCOVID-19 Emergency Appeal, which is facilitating and supporting them to maintain critical service provision while \nadapting to the COVID-19 situation. ERCS operation is aligned with and will contribute to the current global strategy and \nregional Emergency Plan of Action (4th Revision) for COVID-19 developed by the IFRC Africa Regional Office, in \ncoordination with global and regional partners.  \nEthiopia Red Cross has recently developed with support from the IFRC COVID-19 vaccine plan and consequently \nacquired extra logistical support through IFRC funding to increase its capacity to support mass vaccine uptake in the \ncountry. ERCS is in a consortium of national societies receiving funding for COVID19 vaccine operation from the global \nAfrica- CDC and IFRC partnership on COVID19 Vaccine \n IFRC continues to assess how emergency operations in response to disasters and crises should adapt to this crisis \nand provide necessary guidance to its membership on the same and the NS will ensure COVID-19 prevention measures \nare mainstreamed in all operations to deal with exceptional needs of affected communities as a result of the emergency. \nERCS will keep monitoring the situation closely and revise the plan accordingly if needed, taking into consideration the \nevolving COVID-19 situation and the operational risks that might develop, including operational challenges related to \naccess to the affected population, availability of cash and livelihoods items, procurement issues, and movement of \nERCS volunteers and staff as well as international staff. For more information, please consult the COVID-19 Operations \nPage on the IFRC Go platform.  \n \n \nB. Operational strategy3 \n \nOverall objectives: Support 50,000 people of the drought-affected population in the Somali region, and Moyale and \nBoran zones of the Oromia region, through a 6-month multisectoral intervention. \n \nProposed Strategy: ERCS will focus on the most vulnerable people in the targeted regions. With a Priority being given \nto support economically vulnerable households who are most affected by the drought with no alternative coping \nstrategies, as guided by standard humanitarian practices and with no overlapping assistance. The assistance will cover \nbasic needs of livelihood/food, Wash and health services with a protection and community engagement approach in the \nspecific migration and security context.  Per sectors, the proposed intervention will be as follow:  \n \nOperational learning to be considered in this response: \nERCS operational learning from past intervention will serve to complement the actual response. The following point will \nbe considered in this strategy: A close follow-up with IFRC support must be put in place to ensure procurement is \ncomplete in the time of the operation. Considering the delay observed in previous interventions that led to extensions, \nERCS is planning the intervention for an extended implementation period of 6 months directly. In addition, regarding \nlessons learnt from the previous Food insecurity DREF MDRET026, although the projects were all completed, the needs \nof communities have increased or are constantly complexified by conflicts. In the previous DREF MDRET026 food \nsecurity, the implementation was closely follow-up and completed. However, these communities were later affected by \nconflict in the third wave of escalation when war came close to Addis Ababa. a situation that was not foreseen because \nthe project was implemented in that range.  \nEthiopian Red Cross Society (ERCS) has 37 branches across the country and 5,000 active volunteers supporting the \nmultiple interventions on which NS is taken part with IFRC and other partners. The NS has sufficient resources to lead \nmultiple large-scale operations. And ERCS will also ensure required staff and volunteers are mobilised without impinging \non ongoing operations.  \nERCS in the past two years has considerably strengthened its capacity in Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA) \nprogramming. NS has also good operational experience on this type of crisis and intervention in collaboration with IFRC \non multiple Emergency Appeals and DREF. It delivers 90% of its interventions through cash and is used by all the \npartners and so far, it has been an efficient and transparent process. In the last series of coordination meetings scaling \ncapacities in the regions with cash, experts were raised subject to resources. For this operation, a surge cash expert \nwill also provide additional technical support to complete this intervention.  \n \n \n \n \n3 The plan should be prepared by the National Society, with support from the Secretariat technical departments and support services. \nP a g e  | 10 \n \n \n \n \n \nPublic \nBasic Needs and Livelihoods: target is 15,000 people \nThe intervention will ensure that access to food for the affected population is not further compromised, nor the nutritional \nstatus of the most vulnerable such as children aged under five years old, lactating, pregnant mothers, the elderly and \nthose living with a disability.  \nERCS has also considerably strengthened its capacity in Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA) programming as a \nresponse option. It has an established Financial Service Provider (FSP), the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, which has \nenabled it to reach populations across the country with CVA programming and has an appointed CVA focal point. Cash \nfeasibility and risk assessments have been conducted in most regions of the country \u2013 and it presents a viable option \nfor ERCS to efficiently address the multitude of needs, including immediate household food insecurity, that is emerging \nacross Ethiopia. Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (FSP), which is the largest bank network in the country, has branches in \nall zones and is accessible to affected populations at inconvenient distances. Since the disbursement modality is through \na targeted beneficiary individual account, the cash transfer is safe, confidential and a free service both for ERCS and \nthe beneficiary. In the service provider agreement, the bank provides the service as a humanitarian compliment from its \ncooperate responsibility and charges no cost on ERCS nor the targeting population nor does these beneficiary accounts \nhave any limits or conditions including account maintenance balance or transaction charges. This applies only to ERCS \nhumanitarian services \nMultipurpose cash transfers will be used as a short-term lifesaving mechanism to deliver this strategy through criteria-\nbased targeting. Cash will be delivered using the ERCS\u2019 existing Financial Service Provider (FSP) - Commercial Bank \nof Ethiopia through direct recipient bank accounts. However, where the bank is not accessible ERCS will procure \nalternative service providers feasible in the region through standard IFRC guidelines following IFRC compliance. ERCS \nwill provide sensitization on the process of targeting, registration, account opening and access to cash, to targeted \nhouseholds. \nTargeted families will receive one instalment of ETB 6,000 cash assistance per household based on the minimum \nexpenditure basket (MEB). The MEB is derived from cash feasibility and market assessment carried out by ERCS and \nis harmonised with the transfer value used by other humanitarian actors, which covers basic food and non-food items. \nThe amount is only an indicative average of what is in the minimum need and what actors are given as assistance. \nMarket price and Households needs will be triangulated before distribution at the same time of beneficiary identification \nand registration. \nVolunteers will be trained in CVA and related CEA requirements and will be subsequently engaged to facilitate the \ndelivery processes of the cash assistance. Alongside cash activities, ERCS will engage affected populations on \ncomplementary activities that support the utilisation of the cash received; this includes nutritional awareness, discussions \non management of cash for example through sensitisation sessions with both women and men on the cash benefitting \nthe entire household, ensuring that volunteers are aware of referral mechanisms between humanitarian organizations \nas well as public services and know-how to make safe and confidential referrals (e.g. to SGBV case management, \nhealth, child protection, malnutrition and therapeutic care centres etc.). In addition, a surge with cash and voucher \nassistance profile will be deployed to follow up this process closely. \nERCS as part of the operation activities will conduct Post distribution monitoring (PDM) and market monitoring to assess \nthe relevance, acceptance and effects of the response which will also inform feedback and as lessons for future \nprogramming.  \n \nWater Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH): target is 50,000 people \nWASH needs were cited by all assessments as a priority. Most water sources have dried and there is heavy reliance on \nthe boreholes which are also experiencing exhaustion and frequent breakdowns. Water assessment in the Moyale and \nBoran zones reflected that water costs for a 20lt gallon increased 20-40 ETB depending on the distance:  \nThe proposed WASH sector intervention strategies include:  \n\u2022 \nProvision of HH water storage containers (jerrican 20 l)  \n\u2022 \nWater treatment tablets  \n\u2022 \nBoreholes operations maintenance through the supply of fast-moving servicing parts and replaceable items  \n\u2022 \nTraining volunteers on hygiene promotion  \n\u2022 \nSafe disposal of livestock carcasses at water points and homesteads  \n\u2022 \nHygiene promotion and sensitisation on the use of wash material with IEC material printing \n\u2022 \nDignity kit distribution to women of childbearing age. \n \n \n \nP a g e  | 11 \n \n \n \n \n \nPublic \nHealth and Nutrition: target is 50,000 people \nConduct community MHPSS sessions, engaging local associations and community platforms including religious and \neducation stakeholders. This will be psychosocial First Aid (PFA) done through group and individual one on one sessions \nbased on needs identified by professional PFA providers.  \nSensitize community Health Volunteers on nutrition surveillance through the family MUAC approach. Training and \nsensitization of 30 caregivers on family MUAC and referrals and equip them with the screening materials. \nContinuous nutritional surveillance and screening of under-fives, pregnant and lactating mothers and sensitizing the \ncommunity for linkage to care facilities for proper management of the nutrition care and support pathway. In the event \nthe acute malnutrition levels surge with the increased caseload, ERCS can partner with the Ministry of Health or any \nother health and nutrition expert NGO providing facility-level clinical and therapeutic care to adequately provide social \nmobilization, community awareness and linkage to care facilities. \n \nProtection, Gender, and Inclusion (PGI)  \nFood insecurity is the primary effect of drought emergency as reflected in all the different progressive assessments \ncarried out and food insecurity is a driver of protection issues that results in negative coping strategies including child \nlabour, child marriages, sexual and gender-based violence, trafficking, sexual exploitation, and abuse. \nPGI will therefore be mainstreamed throughout this intervention to ensure communities' dignity, access, participation, \nand safety. As part of the need\u2019s assessment and analysis, a gender, protection and diversity analysis have been in \nassessment and will continue to understand and respond to individuals and groups in the affected community, based \non their specific risks, needs and concerns. And will inform the operational strategies. IFRC is supporting through the \nMDRTIGRAY Emergency Appeal the recruitment position of PGI coordinator which will oversee and technically support \nrelative activities in this DREF.  \nAcknowledging that women, girls, men and boys with diverse ages, disabilities and backgrounds have very different \nneeds, risks and coping strategies, there is a need to: \n\u2022 \nConduct PGI assessment in the targeted area \n\u2022 \nEquip staff and volunteers with skills and knowledge on PGI, with more emphasis on the practical application \nof the PGI minimum standards (Dignity, Access, Participation and Safety) \n\u2022 \nInclude SGBV messages and awareness including safe referral pathways in community sensitisation \nsessions \n\u2022 \nEnsuring all staff and volunteers in this operation receive briefings on Protection of sexual exploitation and \nabuse (PSEA) and code of conduct and they sign the code of conduct \n\u2022 \nCollection and analysis of Sex, age, and disability disaggregated data (SADDD) in ERCS operations. \n\u2022 \nIntegrating PGI in assessments and ensuring a gender and diversity analysis guides the operational strategy. \n\u2022 \nProvide dignity kits for vulnerable women and adolescent girls  \n\u2022 \nCoordinating with CEA in the handling of sensitive complaints in community feedback and response systems \n\u2022 \nEnsure PGI is integrated in all sectors \n\u2022 \nIn engaging with communities ensure gender and diversity is factored in and that women, persons with \ndisabilities, youth, children are engaged at all levels in the response. \n \nCommunity Engagement and Accountability (CEA):  \nCEA will be integrated into the response interventions to ensure the engagement and involvement of all stakeholders \nincluding the community members of the affected populations. Communities will be consulted at all stages of the \nresponse and be given opportunities to participate in and influence operational and programme decisions. In addition, \ntwo-way information sharing approaches will be used to inform community members about the operation including the \nselection criteria, distribution processes, participation/dialogue platforms, etc. This will be completed as part of the \npreparedness/set-up activity across the branches involved in the implementation of this DREF; and may include \nplatforms such as community meetings, radio shows and/or social media depending on what the preferred and trusted \ncommunication channels of the communities are as well as their appropriateness to the context in the respective area.  \n \nCommunity feedback and response systems will be established to listen to people\u2019s feedback, questions, and concerns \nabout the response and the data will be analysed and discussed with communities to understand where improvements \nneed to be made. Communities will be made aware of the established ERCS feedback system, how to use it as well as \nthe role of the volunteers in the feedback system. The community will also be supported in the establishment of \ncommunity feedback committees for reliable and swift relay of information, feedback, and complaints. Sensitive feedback \nwill be handled through the referral pathways highlighted in the ERCS PSEA policy. Communication and dissemination \nof Fundamental Principles will be a component of the CEA activities to ensure access and acceptance. To ensure the \nP a g e  | 12 \n \n \n \n \n \nPublic \neffective integration of CEA and accountability of the response, staff and volunteers will receive training on CEA and \ncommunity feedback systems \n \nFor all intervention strategies of this DREF, the ERCS will ensure coordination with Government authorities at all levels, \nrelevant stakeholders and thematic clusters to ensure complementarity, transparency and coordination. As noted, ERCS \nwill conduct a PDM of the cash disbursement and will conduct a lesson learnt workshop for reflective learning and \nimproving on future programming.  \n \nExit strategy  \nAcknowledging that funding from DREF is for immediate response during an emergency thus the operations it supports \nfocus on immediate life-saving interventions.  \nThe scale of the drought and the needs raised by the assessment will require a bigger response in terms of scope and \ntime. In this respect, this DREF will be upgraded to an emergency appeal for wider coverage by geography and \ndemographic targeting and to address early recovery and rehabilitation needs to strengthen resilience and preparedness \ncapacities  \nERCS will carry out advocacy and popularise the impact of the project to attract potential partners including ECHO, UN \nbodies and other multi-lateral agencies and within the RCRC Movement, in a bid to highlight the silent food crisis \naffecting communities outside of those directly affected by the Tigray crisis and in alignment with the Pan African Zero \nHunger Initiative 2021-2030 through sustainable medium- long-term solutions to address the risks of hunger in Ethiopia. \nA launch of an Emergency appeal covering the most affected countries is in line with this perspective.  \nERCS and IFRC will work to ensure that there is the transfer of competencies on the lesson learnt following project \nimplementation, to ensure the sustainability of the impact on the community and to document a larger response to be \nlaunched. The Ethiopia complex crisis appeal and the food security drought response will eventually converge towards \nan Ethiopia-wide recovery and resilience strategy.  \n \nOperational support services \n\u27a2 Planning, Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting (PMER)  \nEmphasis is made on encouraging continuous assessment of the situation, monitoring of the services being provided \nas well as looking at monitoring of the feedback from beneficiaries. Analysis of monitoring data and reports will be used \nfor decision-making and continuous improvement of the implementation. Attention will be paid to data management, \ninclusive of the collection of disaggregated beneficiary data, storage, and analysis.  \nPost-distribution monitoring is planned, and a lesson learn to get the achieved results to assess and have operational \nlearning that will document the potential scaled up of this operation or any planned operation on Drought related issue. \nContinuous communication with the field teams, along with the issuance of necessary updates of the operation including \nthe final report will be managed accordingly. The IFRC Operations Manager based in Addis Ababa will work with the \nERCS team to ensure monitoring of the operation for quality, quantity, scope, and quantity as well as transparency and \naccountability in its delivery. \n\u27a2 Human Resources  \nERCS human resources involved in the operation include 100 volunteers engaged in distinct functions in WASH CEA; \nPGI the implementation of the operation will be supported by the ERCS respective branches in the regions of Somali \nand Oromia. The regional programs coordinator will also oversee the implementation and will be supported from national \nheadquarters (NHQ) by the focal operations coordinator delegated from the Disaster Preparedness and Response \n(DPR) team by the director of programs. The National society's systemic capacities, staffing and volunteer capacities \nand network is an asset to the operation. Any gaps will be resourced by the operation. Most importantly focal response \ntechnical coordinators could be considered in each region. \nIFRC surge field officer cash expert will be deployed to support locally the implementation of the operation for 3 months. \n\u27a2 Finance and administration \nFinancial resources will be safeguarded by high quality financial and administrative practices supported and monitored \nby ERCS and IFRC finance staff at national and regional levels. Compliance with IFRC logistics and financial procedures \nwill be observed and continuous monitoring and technical support will be provided by IFRC to ensure agreed standards \nare met. ERCS is on funds transfer modality and IFRC Finance officers in the AU- delegation in the country will conduct \nspot checks for the operation as per the framework agreements and the WWPP funds transfer modality requirements. \n \nP a g e  | 13 \n \n \n \n \n \nPublic \n\u27a2 Logistics and Procurement management  \nLocal procurement will be carried out for all material requirements like PPEs, IEC and/or visibility of the operation within \nthe National Society\u2019s threshold of the WWPP framework following the IFRC standard procurement procedures. \nProcurement processes will be administered by ERCS HQ and the IFRC Operations manager will support the \ncompliance process. For the cash to be disbursed for food assistance, ERCS will conduct the market and cash feasibility \nassessment to determine the mode of delivery (cash or voucher). ERCS has a pre-existing agreement with financial \nservice provider Commercial bank of Ethiopia for provision services.  \n \n\u27a2 Communications  \nERCS will regularly share information and updates on the operation via a range of communications channels and the \nSecretary-General will be the primary spokesperson for communications to external stakeholders within Ethiopia. IFRC \nwill support the ERCS communications team to communicate with external audiences with a focus on food security and \nthe Red Cross humanitarian action assisting people affected by disasters. The communications will generate visibility \nand provide advocacy for both humanitarian and sustainable support in the food security sector.  ERCS will ensure close \ntechnical collaboration with the IFRC African regional communications unit for a coherent and coordinated \ncommunications approach.  \n\u27a2 Security  \nThe security situation in the country at large because of the fighting in different regions is fluid. However, since the onset \nof the Tigray crisis the ERCS in collaboration with the PNS have invested capacity in security.  The operational area \nsupported by the DREF is a considerable distance from Tigray and areas of Afar and Amhara where there has been a \nspillover of violence.   \nSecurity coordination is an integral part of the coordination of partners and through the different coordination platforms.  \nAdvisory support will be sought through this forum; as well as in coordination with the IFRC security officer in Ethiopia; \nand proactive measures will be taken to ensure that the operation is not adversely affected and or for timely re- strategy \nin the event of any recurrence. \nTo reduce the risk of personnel falling victim to crime, violence or road hazards active risk mitigation measures must be \nadopted. This includes situation monitoring and implementation of minimum-security standards. IFRC security plans will \napply to all IFRC personnel throughout.  All RCRC personnel actively involved in the operations must have completed \nthe respective IFRC security e-learning courses (i.e., Stay Safe Level 1 Fundamentals, Level 2 Personal and Volunteer \nSecurity in emergencies, Level 3 Security for Managers).   \n \n \nP a g e  | 14 \n \n \n \n \n \nPublic \nC.

Situation Analysis  \n \nDescription of the disaster  \n \nSince 2017, the country has been facing one of the worst drought crises ever since the 1990s. Rains continue to be \nrare, and production does not even cover 1% of the country's food needs. The majority of the Cape Verdean population \nlives from agriculture (22% of the active population is employed by the agricultural sector, of which 82% is in rural \nareas). This situation leads 24.2% of the population to live in poverty and 9.2% in extreme poverty. \n \nEmergency Action Plan (EPoA) \nCape Verde: Drought  \n \nP a g e  | 2 \n \n \nInternal \n \nFarmers find it more and more difficult to continue their productive \nactivities. After more than four seasons of considerable rainfall deficit, \nagricultural productivity yields have deteriorated considerably and \naquifers did not recharge, which affects access to water for the \npopulation and their livelihood activities. \n \nThe 2021-2022 agro pastoral campaign was characterized by a late \nstart and an early end to the rains, throughout the national territory. \nOverall agricultural production varies from low to nil, depending on \nthe agro-climatic strata of the municipalities. Cereal production is \nestimated at 640 tons of maize, recording an 80% decrease, \ncompared to the average of the last 5 years. As for bean production, \nit has fallen by 90% compared to the average of the last 5 years, and \nstands at 197 tons.1 \n \nAs a result, the Government of Cape Verde has declared, on 16 \nFebruary 2022, the situation of national drought emergency \ndisaster. This was contrary to the forecasts of the Agrhymet Center \nwhich predicted a campaign with a rainfall varying from normal to \nexcess and a regular to early start for the Sahel region. \n \nAt the national level, production of fodder has been regular to low, \nand data show that the situation is normal in the southern islands and \nweak in the northern islands, where the most critical situation is in the \nmunicipality of Porto Novo, on the island of Santo Ant\u00e3o. The \nphytosanitary situation was characterized by the strong and localized \nattack of the \u201cOedaleus Senegalensis\u201d locust on the islands of \nSantiago, Maio, Fogo and Brava. There was also a widespread attack \nof the \"green bug\" on maize and bean crops. \n \nGiven the adverse conditions linked to the agro-pastoral agricultural campaign, some municipalities in the country are \nin a situation of acute food insecurity. The results of the Harmonized Framework (March 2022), presented as part of \nthe Regional Food Crisis Prevention and Management System (PREGEC) held 28 - 30 March 2022 show a current \nsituation of food insecurity affecting 29,421 people in the phase of crisis (Ph 3), and 1,076 people in the \nemergency phase (Ph 4), mainly on the island of Santiago (in the municipality of Ribera Grande, which was the only \none recorded in phase 3), and a projected situation for this year's lean period (June to August 2022) of 46,093 \npeople in food insecurity (10% of the population) including 43,003 in crisis (Ph 3) and 3,090 in the emergency \nphase (Ph 4)2. \n \nFrom June to August 2022, 4 municipalities will be in phase 3 (crisis), namely: Porto Novo on the island of Santo Ant\u00e3o, \nand Sao Domingos, Santa Cruz and Ribeira Grande on the island of Santiago. Considering the current situation and \nthe anticipated situation, it is important to start a number of response and preparedness actions while putting in place \nanticipatory measures to limit the impact of the projected drought and reduce the vulnerability of the most vulnerable \npopulations at risks mentioned above. \n \n1 Source: Presentation - Harmonized Framework for Analysis and Identification of Areas at Risk and Estimation of Food Insecure Populations in Cabo Verde, \nPraia, March 7-11, 2022 \n2 Source: Communication sheet CH de Cabo Verde \"Harmonized framework for identifying areas and estimating populations in acute food and nutrition insecurity \nin Cabo Verde - Current situation (March-April-May 2022) and projected (June- July-August 2022)\", March 2022 \n \nImage : Bulletin Officiel de la R\u00e9publique du \nCap Vert (16 f\u00e9vrier 2022) \n \nP a g e  | 3 \n \n \nInternal \nPhasing \nZones \nPopulation \nPopulation (%) \nCurrent \nProjected \nCurrent \nProjected \nCurrent \nProjected \nPh1 \n4 \n2 \n346,464 \n299,473 \n72 \n62 \nPh2 \n17 \n16 \n106,666 \n138,062 \n22 \n29 \nPh3 \n1 \n4 \n29,421 \n4,3003 \n6 \n9 \nPh4 \n0 \n0 \n1,076 \n3,090 \n0,2 \n1 \nPh5 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0,0 \n0 \nTotal \n22 \n22 \n483,627 \n483,628 \n100 \n100 \n \nSource: Analysis of the harmonized framework - March 2022. Results of the analysis of the harmonized framework \u00e9 \n(March 2022) on the current situation and the projected situation (June to August 2022). \n \nSummary of the current intervention  \n \nOverview of Host National Society action \n \nThe Red Cross Society of Cape Verde (RCSCV), through its local branches and in close collaboration and cooperation \nwith the decentralized structures of the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment and the municipal coordination bodies \nof the areas, participates in the various coordination meetings set up by the Cape Verdean government, including the \nworkshops of the harmonized framework at national level. \n \nRCCV has experience in the implementation of DREF operations3 and in food security and nutrition. The National \nSociety (NS) teams have both theoretical and practical skills in the area of food security and livelihoods (SAME), thanks \nto an in-depth assessment carried out in 2018 on the islands of Santiago and Santo Ant\u00e3o. This evaluation mobilized \nseveral volunteers and staff from RCCV and counted on the support of two staff sent by the Livelihood Center (CME) \nhosted by the Spanish Red Cross. \n \nDuring the COVID 19 pandemic, RCCV mobilized more than 300 volunteers to provide food assistance to vulnerable \npeople who were in lockdown. \n \nThe NS team is composed of one ERU WASH and FACT, 7 RDRT members, 60 NDRT members and more than 450 \nCommunity Disaster Response Team (CDRT) members of all backgrounds. As part of this operation, it is planned  to \nmobilize around 250 volunteers, including 3 in general coordination, a volunteer specialist in food security and \nlivelihoods (SAME), and all the support services (finance and logistics) of the Secretariat. Field activities will be carried \nout on different fronts in accordance with the main lines of action defined in the operational strategy. \n \nRCCV actively participates in Sahel+ initiatives, including the Migration and SAME technical groups. During the last \ngeneral assembly of the Sahel+, held in March 2022 in The Gambia, the RCCV were chairing the network. \n \nOverview of the action of the RCRC Movement in the country \n \nThere is no representation of the Red Cross Movement in Cape Verde. The RCCV receives technical and financial \nsupport from Partner National Societies (PNS - Spanish, Luxembourg, and Canadian Red Cross Societies), from ICRC \nand from the Federation. The IFRC will ensure regular support is provided to the NS to respond to this disaster and \nregular coordination will be put in place. The Spanish Red Cross has funded various projects in the field of food \nsecurity, in particular between 1997 and 2000. Following the drought situation and the 2017 \u2013 2018 poor agricultural \nseasons, the Spanish Red Cross assisted the NS in carrying out field assessments and analysing the data collected. \nThe Luxembourg and Canadian Red Cross Societies, provided support in the fight against COVID-19 and disaster \npreparedness and response, etc. \n \nA cash and voucher assistance specialist from the Burkinabe Red Cross will be mobilized through the British Red \nCross' Cash School to build the team\u2019s capacities in the area and support the contracting process with the Financial \nServices Provider. \n \nThe NS also receives funding from the UK government (Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office-FCDO), \nthrough the Risk-Based Early Action Partnership (REAP) whose Secretariat is hosted by the IFRC. This project, with \n \n3 In 2014, Operation DREF Fogo Volcano of CHF 119,069, targeting 2,500 people; and in 2009, Operation DREF Dengue Outbreak of CHF 153,951, targeting 75,000 \npeople. \nP a g e  | 4 \n \n \nInternal \nthe technical support of the IFRC, falls within the framework of REAP target 1, \"50 countries can review and integrate \ntheir laws, policies and/or crisis/disaster risk management plans and climate adaptation, to ensure that they reduce \nthe impacts of climate change and the exposure of people and the environment\".  \n \nThe specific objectives of the project are to: \ni) \nDevelop the capacities of key stakeholders, operating at the junction of disasters and climate; \nii) \nSupport the development of national regulatory frameworks for disaster risk management adapted to \nclimate change, which responds to the needs of the most vulnerable and involves local communities; \niii) \nShare best practices and promote recommendations to develop more coherent legal and policy \nframeworks for disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA). \n \nOverview of external Red Cross/Red Crescent actors in the country \n \nFor this emergency, the Cape Verdean Government has opted for the approval and implementation of an \"Emergency \nprogramme for the mitigation of the drought and the poor 2021/2022 agricultural Year \" (Resolution No. 13 /2022 of 16 \nFebruary, 2022) based on 3 major groups of measures to be implemented: \n\u2022 \nLivestock rescue: protect the breeding activity and ensure the conditions for the maintenance of ruminant \nbreeding. \n\u2022 \nManagement of water shortage: addressing the problem of water shortage by ensuring rational use and \nregularity of supply for households and agricultural and livestock holdings. \n\u2022 \nJob creation for affected families: protection of livelihoods with special attention to the most vulnerable \nfamilies (women and young people). \n \nThe Government of Cape Verde also benefits from the technical support of NGOs and UN agencies such as Action \nagainst Hunger (ACF), OXFAM and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and financial \nsupport from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the French Development Agency (AFD) \nand the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). \n \nNeeds analysis, beneficiary selection, scenario planning and risk assessment \n \nAnalysis of the Needs  \n \nCape Verde is an archipelago of ten islands \nand thirteen islets, located approximately 450 \nkm from Senegal.  It has an area of 4,033 \nkm2 and an exclusive economic zone \nestimated at 700,000 km2. Natural resources \nare scarce, the vast majority of soils are poor \nin organic matter and only 10% of land is \npotentially arable. Since its independence in \n1975, Cape Verde has been resolutely \ncommitted to the fight against desertification \nand the effects of drought. \n \nRainfall is generally low throughout the \ncountry, not exceeding 300 mm annual \naverage for 65% of the territory located at \nless than 400 m altitude. The areas under the \ninfluence of the trade winds being even drier \n(150 mm annual average). On the slopes \nlocated at more than 500 m of altitude facing \nthe trade winds, it can reach or exceed 700 \nmillimetres. \n \nSince 2017, the rainy seasons have been \nmore and more irregular and insufficient, and has impacted the availability of water and agricultural yield (agriculture \nand livestock) which have been considerably reduced as indicated by the declaration of the situation of national \ndisaster announced by the Government on 16 February, 2022. \n \nSource: Cape Verde Harmonised Framework Communication Sheet - \nProjected situation from June to August 2022 \nHarmonised Framework: analysis of acute food and nutrition insecurity \nprojected situation; June-July-August 2022 \nP a g e  | 5 \n \n \nInternal \nAccording to the Government4, given the results of the Harmonized Framework of March 2022, the number of people \nestimated to be in severe food insecurity (phases 3, 4) for the lean season (between June and August 22) amounts \nto 46,093 people, i.e., 9,218 households (10% of the population), including 43,003 in crisis (Ph 3) and 3,090 in \nemergency phase (Ph 4). \n \nThe areas most affected by this food insecurity, for the projected period, are the localities of Porto Novo (in Santo \nAnt\u00e3o), Santa Cruz, Ribeira Grande and Sao Domingo (in the island of Santiago). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe number of people (and households) at risk of food insecurity (Ph 2), is quite high, 138,062 people, or 27,612 \nhouseholds (29% of the population). \nThese figures refer to vulnerable populations affected by the climate shock (drought) and the COVID-19 \npandemic. To prevent the situation of affected population that are already under pressure/stress from worsening and \nmoving into phase 3 (crisis), the food insecurity of these populations must be monitored5.  \n \nLivelihoods and basic needs \nThe drought is compromising the food, nutritional, and economic security of households in these areas, jeopardizing \ntheir ability to meet their basic needs in the coming months and to invest in their livelihoods to ensure the continuity of \nthe agricultural season (after one \u201cfailed\u201dbad season, 2021-2022).  \nFood insecurity and malnutrition are likely to affect mainly small-scale farmers who have not recorded any production \ndue to the low diversification of their household economy, with a focus on female-headed households. \nFollowing the recommendations set out in the analysis of the Harmonized Framework6 for mitigating food insecurity \nforecasts and depletion of productive assets, in the short term, the priority needs of affected households are as follows: \n\u2022 \nCovering food needs during the peak of the lean season (June to September) to avoid depletion of assets and \nproductive assets; \n\u2022 \nThe provision of feed for animals (remaining herds of small ruminants) and support for destocking by slaughter; \n\u2022 \nThe need for assistance to help secure the livelihoods (agriculture and livestock) of the most vulnerable \npopulations during the next agricultural season. \n \nThe country has been experiencing several factors over the past three years that have disrupted the local market and \ncreated inflation in certain goods and services. In particular, the low agricultural production observed in recent years, \nthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the crisis in Ukraine have affected the markets for imported products, as is \nthe case for Cape Verde. The level of supply of agricultural products to the markets is generally more or less normal \nand regular. The supply of commodities was guaranteed and stable in all of the country's municipalities during the \nanalysis period, but monitoring of the market situation and ongoing assessment are necessary for this response to be \neffective. \n \n \n4 Source: Communication sheet CH de Cabo Verde \"Harmonized framework for identifying areas and estimating populations in acute food and nutrition insecurity \nin Cabo Verde - Current situation (March-April-May 2022) and projected (June- July-August 2022)\", March 2022 \n5 Source: Communication sheet CH de Cabo Verde \"Harmonized framework for identifying areas and estimating populations in acute food and nutrition insecurity \nin Cabo Verde - Current situation (March-April-May 2022) and projected (June- July-August 2022)\", March 2022 \n6 Source: Communication sheet CH de Cabo Verde \"Harmonized framework for identifying areas and estimating populations in acute food and nutrition insecurity \nin Cabo Verde - Current situation (March-April-May 2022) and projected (June- July-August 2022)\", March 2022 \n \n \n2nd \nadministrative \nlevel \n \n3rd \nadministrative \nlevel \n \nclassi\nficatio\nn \nof \nthe \narea \n \npercentage of households affected by \neach TSP \ntotal \npopul\nation \nin \nphase \n1 \n \ntotal \npopul\nation \nin \nphase \n2 \n \ntotal \npop\nulati\non \nin \npha\nse 3 \n \ntotal \npopul\nation \nin \nphase \n4 \n \ntotal \npopul\nation \nin \nphase \n5 \n \ntotal \npop\nulati\non \nin \npha\nse  \n \nP a g e  | 6 \n \n \nInternal \nHealth \n \nThe drought situation in Cape Verde mainly affects the livelihoods of more vulnerable agricultural producers and \npastoralists, who are more at risk of being affected by malnutrition even in regular situations. According to a national \nsurvey on family nutrition and nutritional vulnerability conducted in 2018, 11% of children under 5 years present a \npicture of chronic malnutrition, 4.4% acute malnutrition and 5% underweight. The negative effects of malnutrition are \nparticularly felt among children aged 0-59 months) and pregnant or lactating women. \n \nFood insecurity is a major contributing factor to acute malnutrition, combined with inadequate food intake, low dietary \ndiversity among children and women, and a high prevalence of diseases (diarrhea, ARI, and malaria) linked to limited \naccess to water and health services. The COVID-19 epidemic was also an unusual shock, exacerbating malnutrition. \n \nWater, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) \n \nThe targeted communities face the problems of water scarcity, deterioration of existing water sources and dry \nagricultural land. They do not have access to good quality drinking water for their own consumption and for livestock \nand agriculture. Many people have to travel for many kilometres to find water for drinking or use tankers to irrigate their \nfields and give water to their livestock. Given the cost of water, many prefer to sell their livestock. It is therefore crucial \nto ensure that existing water points, which are already inadequate, are protected. \n \nProtection, gender and inclusion (PGI) \n \nThe duration of the crisis, and the time of exposure to the lack of means to provide families with basic needs, puts \npressure on heads of households, especially in the case of single-parent households or households with a high \ndependency ratio, and mainly those headed by women, disabled and elderly persons, with a greater workload or fewer \nresources to meet household needs. \n \nCommunity Engagement and Accountability (CEA) \n \nAffected populations should be consulted and involved in the needs assessment, the identification of response options, \nwhile we consider their perception on how these options match their needs. The first step is to identify the best \ncommunication channels to effectively inform communities and individuals about the targets and objectives of the \nhumanitarian assistance. The best way to collaborate with affected communities must then be determined according \nto the context and the feedback received. \n \nTargeting  \n \nThe RCCV will concentrate the humanitarian assistance in Ribeira Grande de Santiago, on the island of Santiago, and \nin Porto Novo, on the island of Santo Ant\u00e3o, as these two localities are the most affected (now and later on in June to \nAugust based on projections) by the drought and present a major risk of food insecurity cases in crisis and emergency. \nIt is projected that in these two locations, 6,026 people (1,205 households) would be severely food insecure between \nJune and August 2022, either in crisis (4,448 people) or emergency (1,578 people).  \n \nThe proposed targeting by intervention sector is as follows: \n \nSector \n \nActivities \nTarget \nLivelihoods and basic \nneeds  \nResponse actions \nFood assistance (cash transfers) \n400 households (2,000 \npeople \nAnticipated actions \nSupport to farmers (cash transfers \nfor purchase of seeds and fertilizer) \n100 households (500 \npeople) \n \nAnticipated actions \nSupport to livestock farmers (cash \ntransfers) for the purchase of feed \nand support for animal vaccination \n100 households (500 \npeople) \n \nResponse actions \nSupport for destocking through \nslaughter \n50 households (250 people) \n \nResponse/ preparation \n \nAwareness sessions for farmers and \nherders \n500 people \n \nHealth \nResponse/ preparation \n \nMalnutrition screening campaigns \n1,000 people \n \nResponse/ preparation \n \n \nDistribution of nutritional \nsupplements for a period of \nthree months \n200 people (children from 6 \nto 59 months and/or \npregnant and lactating \nwomen) \nP a g e  | 7 \n \n \nInternal \n \nResponse/ preparation \n \nAwareness sessions and cooking \ndemonstrations \n500 people \nWater, sanitation and \nhygiene (WASH) \nAnticipated actions \nRepair and maintenance of tanks, \nwells and/or boreholes in identified \nlocalities \n6,026 people \nAnticipated and response \nactions \nDistribution of buckets and jerry \ncans \n500 households (2,500 \npeople) \n \nAnticipated and response \nactions \nHygiene promotion and awareness \nactivities \n500 households (2,500 \npeople) \n \nProtection, gender \nand inclusion (PGI) \nResponse/ preparation \n \nCross-cutting actions for the entire \ntarget population \n6,026 people \nCommunity \nEngagement and \nAccountability (CEA) \nResponse/ preparation \n \nImplementation of the community \nfeedback mechanism \n6,026 people \n \nFurther evaluation during the implementation of this DREF will allow to adjust the number of people targeted, if \nnecessary by municipality, and provide disaggregated data.

Strategy of the operation \n \nOverall objective \n \nThe overall objective of this appeal is to respond to the immediate needs of the population affected by the \ncurrent drought and reduce their vulnerability to severe food insecurity and malnutrition in the coming \nmonths. This will be done in the localities of Ribeira Grande de Santiago, on the island of Santiago, and \nPorto Novo, on the island of Santo Ant\u00e3o, by providing immediate food assistance, implementing livelihood \npreparedness and protection activities, deploying actions to prevent malnutrition, ensuring better access to \nwater, and raising awareness on hygiene and sanitation issues. \n \nPlanned activities will also allow strengthening RCCV's disaster preparedness and response capacity in the \nareas of food security and cash transfers, and strengthen its national volunteers\u2019 network.  \n \nThis DREF operation aims at implementing and anticipating response activities to an impending crisis. The approach \ndeployed is as follows: \n1) Respond to the urgent needs of the most vulnerable populations and those most at risk of food insecurity \nduring the 2022 lean season (June to August 2022). This will be done through the implementation of \nanticipatory actions in water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), protection and strengthening of livelihoods in \nthe medium term (livestock, crops). \n2) Immediate livelihoods assistance response actions in terms of food and basic needs, and health.  \n \nOperational Strategy \n \nThrough this operation, RCCV aims to prevent and mitigate the consequences of the drought and the poor agricultural \nyears impacting the food and nutrition security situation and the protection of the livelihoods of the most vulnerable \naffected populations.  \n \nA needs assessment in the two target localities, including a market assessment, will precede the implementation of \nsectoral activities. \n \nLivelihoods and basic needs \n \n1. Food assistance for 400 households (2,000 people), for three months, through the implementation of an \nunconditional cash transfer programme \na. The Financial Service Provider will be identified and contracting will be completed with the support of the \nCash School specialist. The RCCV has on other occasions (e.g., COVID-19 response activities) agreed \nto ad hoc contracts with a financial services provider. \nb. The Cash School specialist will also contribute to building the capacity of the National Society through \nsustained support over six weeks, including the organization of training/retraining sessions for staff and \nvolunteers. \nc. Amount to be distributed: 12,350 CVE/month per household, for 3 months (i.e., 37,050 CVE/household), \ncalculated on the basis of the costs of the basic food basket (rice, maize, legumes, sugar, and oil) which \nguarantees the minimum ration of 2,100 kcal/person/day. \n \nItem \nQuantity \nUnit \nKcal/p/d \nPrice/unit (CVE) \nTotal price (CVE) \nGrains (rice, corn, flour, \netc.) \n50 \nkg \n1,210 \n140 \n7,000,00 \nLegume \n25 \nkg \n555 \n150 \n3,750,00 \nOil \n5 \nlitre \n295 \n170 \n850,00 \nSugar \n5 \nkg \n129 \n150 \n750,00 \n  \n \n \n2,189 \n \n12,350,00 \n \nMonthly food basket in Cape Verde for a household of 5 people \n \n2. Support to farmers and livestock breeders through the implementation of a cash transfer programme: \na. For farmers (100 households, 500 people): purchase of seeds and fertilizers. \nb. For herders (100 households, 500 people): purchase of feed and support for access to veterinary care. \nP a g e  | 10 \n \n \nInternal \nc. Amount to be distributed: a single transfer of 8,000 CVE/household. \n3. Additional support to livestock farmers (50 households, 250 individuals) through support for slaughter \ndestocking. \n4. Organization of sensitization sessions for farmers and herders, including in collaboration with the technical \nservices of the Ministry of Agriculture. \nDue to the availability of ATMs in the target areas and the presence of financial services, Cash Transfer Programming \nwill be organized. The implementation of the cash transfer programme will be based on lessons learned by the NS \nfrom previous operations. The British Red Cross Cash School will be supported by the deployment of a Cash and \nVoucher Assistance specialist to Cape Verde for a period of six weeks. This support will facilitate and accelerate the \nidentification of a Financial Service Provider that meets the needs of the operation and the IFRC's implementation \nstandards. \n \nHealth \n \n1. Organization of screening campaigns for malnutrition in the two targeted localities, reaching a total of 1,000 \npeople and allowing for the rapid referral of the most at-risk cases. \n2. Distribution of nutritional supplements for 200 people at risk (children aged 6 to 59 months and/or pregnant \nand lactating women), for a period of three months. \n3. Organization of nutrition awareness sessions and cooking demonstrations in the two target localities, reaching \na total of 500 people. \n \nWater, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) \n \n1. Initial assessment of the water, sanitation and hygiene situation in the two target localities. \n2. To ensure a steady supply of water to drought-affected families for both farm irrigation needs and livestock \nactivities, damaged reservoirs, wells and/or boreholes will be identified and rehabilitated. \na. A total of 12 reservoirs and 12 wells and/or boreholes will be identified and rehabilitated. \n3. Based on current information, communities are familiar with the use of water from boreholes. Restoration and \nmaintenance of damaged reservoirs, wells and/or boreholes are integrated to improve access to safer water. \nDistribution of buckets (14L) and jerry cans (10L) for water collection and storage to 500 households (2,500 \npeople). \na. Each household will receive 1 bucket and 2 jerry cans.  \n4. Water purification needs will be determined during the detailed assessment. For now, pending specific needs \nthat may be identified during the assessment, this involves providing water storage equipment for domestic \nuse, crops, and livestock. Hygiene promotion and awareness activities will be carried out in the two target \nlocalities, reaching 500 households (2,500 people). \n \nProtection, Gender and Inclusion (PGI) \n \n1. The initial needs assessment will help to collect and analyse data disaggregated by sex, age and disability \nstatus. \na. The assessment will pay particular attention to the different and distinct needs of women, girls, and \nboys and to needs by locality. It will identify priority cross-cutting actions in risk reduction and AIP. \n2. All sectors of intervention will seek to meet minimum AIP standards in emergency situations. \n3. Organize capacity building sessions on minimum standards for AIP in emergencies, with the support of the \nRCCV AIP Focal Point. \n4. Develop Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for protection and sexual and gender-based violence, \nincluding a mapping of actors, services and referral pathways. \n \nCommunity Engagement and Accountability (CEA) \n \n1. Community members will be consulted during the initial needs assessment, during the implementation of \nsupport activities, and during post-distribution follow-ups. \n2. Participatory approaches will be used to define and communicate selection criteria and validation, for example \nby working with community committees. \n3. Communities will be consulted and informed about the selection criteria and how they can contact the RCCV.  \na. A community feedback system will be established, including a hotline and follow-up during response \nactivities, to ensure that the views of targeted community members are incorporated. \nP a g e  | 11 \n \n \nInternal \nOperational Support Services \n \nHuman Resources \n \nThe RCCV will involve approximately 250 volunteers and professionals in this operation through its central (General \nSecretariat) and local (Local Councils) structures for approximately 4 months. \nFor sensitization activities, in particular the door-to-door visits to families, it will be necessary, once again, to call upon \nmore volunteers properly trained in sensitization, animation and beneficiary satisfaction survey techniques. \nThis estimate includes not only the beneficiaries in various communities, but also staff from other civil society \norganizations who, together, will contribute to the implementation of planned activities. \nAs part of this operation, a National Operations Coordinator with knowledge of food security and IFRC procedures will \nbe identified. He will report directly to the Director of the Disaster Management Department.  \n \nSimilarly, the RCCV will make available a finance person who will be completely dedicated to this operation. \nTwo counterparts (an Operations Manager with experience in cash and voucher assistance for 3 months and an \nAdministration and Finance profile for 2 months) will also be mobilized by the IFRC through the Rapid Response \nsystem to work with the RCCV on a peer-to-peer support basis. \n \nThe Food Security and Livelihoods delegate from the IFRC delegation in Dakar will also be made available to provide \nsupport to the RCCV, remotely and/or through an ad hoc technical support mission. \n \nLogistics and Supply Chain \n \nLogistics activities will focus on the effective management of the supply chain, including procurement, customs \nclearance, fleet, storage and transportation to distribution sites, in accordance with the requirements of the operation \nand IFRC logistics standards, processes and procedures. \n \nThe local supply chain for communities has been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and local prices are also \nfluctuating due to the crisis in Ukraine. The market and supply chain situation will be monitored by the NS as part of \nthis operation and the impact of international changes on the market, prices and access to goods and services needed \nfor food security in the country will be updated in the national contingency plan.  \n \nWith regard to material purchases under this operation, the NS will monitor prices and address any fluctuations that \nrequire a review or change in purchasing strategy. For the 3 months of operations, the RCCV will need field support \nto carry out the response. \n \nCommunication \n \nRCCV will share regular information and updates on the operation with key stakeholders. The operations manager will \nbe responsible for communication with external stakeholders. At operational level, the RCCV and IFRC will undertake \ncommunication activities to increase the visibility of the NS and demonstrate the impact of the Movement's contribution, \nincluding communications with media. The IFRC will support the documentation and publication of the stories on the \nIFRC website and the Go platform. \n \nInformation Technology (IT) \n \nTelephone calls and online communications are already underway between the technical departments at RCCV \nheadquarters and the IFRC, with government stakeholders and other partners. These exchanges will continue \nthroughout the operation to ensure the follow-up of the activities and to monitor the evolution of the situation. \n \nSecurity \n \nCape Verde is a country with stable security and no particular risk. However, in recent years there has been an increase \nin petty assaults and snatchings, particularly in Praia and Tarrafal de Santiago, also, to a lesser extent, in places with \nhigh tourist traffic (Mindelo in S\u00e3o Vicente, Santa Maria in Sal and Sal Rei in Boa Vista). \n \nRestrictions related to the application of sanitary measures in Cape Verde: since March 6, 2022, the state of sanitary \nemergency has been lifted and the Cape Verdean territory has been placed on alert. In this context, the following \nmeasures apply to everyone: the wearing of a mask (that remains recommended outdoor) is mandatory in all closed \nspaces, except for discotheques; to access events with more than 20 people, a certificate of recovery or complete \nvaccination against Covid-19 (with a mandatory booster dose if the last dose of this complete vaccination scheme is \nP a g e  | 12 \n \n \nInternal \nmore than 270 days) or proof of screening (PCR test of less than 72 hours or antigenic test of less than 48 hours) with \na negative test result must be presented. \n \nAll Red Cross Red Crescent personnel actively involved in operations must have completed the IFRC online Stay Safe \ncourses (personal safety, safety management or volunteer safety). The safety of the responders will be ensured \nthrough appropriate equipment and briefings on the risks associated with the operation and the COVID-19 \nenvironment. \n \nPlanning, Monitoring, Evaluation and reporting (PMER) \n \nOngoing monitoring will be carried out at country level and with IFRC. The RCCV will strive to ensure collaboration \nwith other Movement partners who will monitor the progress of the operation and provide the necessary technical \nexpertise. \n \nThe RCCV will ensure the monitoring and reporting of the operation. Brief weekly updates will be provided to the IFRC \nand other partners as relevant on the overall progress of the operation. Periodic reports defined in the funding \nagreements will provide details on the monitoring of indicators. \n \nPost-distribution monitoring will be conducted one week after the end of distributions. \n \nA DREF review will be conducted to assess the impact of this operation and a lessons learned workshop will also be \nheld as part of learning process. \n \nAdministration and Finance \n \nThe National Society has a permanent administration and finance department. A finance person will be fully dedicated \nto this operation. \n \nConsistent with the lessons learned from the RCCV's response to COVID-19, an Administration and Finance profile \nwill be mobilized through the Rapid Response system to strengthen the National Society's capacity and ensure \ncompliance with financial administrative procedures in accordance with the terms and conditions to be addressed in \nthe agreement between the NS and the IFRC. \n \n \n   \n \n \nP a g e  | 13 \n \n \nInternal \nC.

They do not have access to \ngood quality drinking water for their own consumption and for livestock and agriculture. Many people have to travel several kilometres to find drinking water or use \ntankers to irrigate their fields and give water to their livestock. Given the cost of water, many prefer to sell the livestock. It is therefore crucial to ensure that existing \nwater points, which are already insufficient, are protected. \n \nThe RCCV will implement a package of WASH activities in each target area, ensuring improved and sustainable access to safe water for people and livestock in \nunderserved and at-risk rural communities. Access to water will be improved through the rehabilitation of water points, shallow wells and pumping equipment (including \nthe installation of solar pumping systems). \n \nThe RCCV will promote hygiene and sanitation in the target areas by training volunteers and conducting awareness campaigns.

Situation analysis \n \nDescription of the disaster  \n \nThe effect of the drought is on a worsening trend in all \nthe country affecting at a different level the North, East \nand South regions mainly Tigray, Afar, Harari, \nSouthern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region \n(SNNPR) regions Somali and Oromia regions. The \nmost severely impacted regions are the lowland areas \nof southern and eastern Oromia and Somali regions \nespecially the Arid and Semi-Arid (ASAL) region of \nSomali and parts of Oromia and SNNPR are \nexperiencing a deterioration of the situation. The \ndrought prevalence is a result of the two main rainy \nseasons Ganna/GU rains (March-May) and the short \nrainy season (Hagayya/\u2018Dyre\u2019) (October-November), \nwhich has been erratic and characterized by late \nonsets, below-average cumulative quantities, and poor \ndistribution both in time and space in the Somali region \n(southern and eastern Somali region (6 zones)), \n@ FEWS NET: Projected food security outcomes, February 2022 to May 2022 \nEmergency Plan of Action (EPoA) \nEthiopia : Drought emergency in south \nregions \nP a g e  | 2 \n \n \n \n \n \nPublic \nsouthern Oromia region (4 zones ) and SNNPR region (1 zone). Given the forecast for a poor March to May 2022 \nGu/Gana season, The Famine Early Warning Systems (FEWSNET) predicts widespread Crisis (IPC Phase 3) \noutcomes, with worst-drought affected areas likely to face Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes starting late February \n2022. \nThe impacts of drought are already visible, with diminishing pasture and water. Atypical livestock deaths increase water \nstress and looming hunger in the Borana Zone of Oromia region and six zones of the Somali region.  \n                                                                                                                                 \nThe most recent effect of the drought is migration and displacement of both humans and livestock northwards due to \nreduced pasture and water scarcity. Often 200km or 300km northwards with an everyday additional pressure on host \ncommunity\u2019s livelihood also. Social tensions cannot be ruled out as one of the origins and also the effect of migration. \nAn increase in malnutrition levels and related opportunistic diseases among children under five, lactating and pregnant \nwomen are already being felt and may increase further if quick action is not taken.  \nUNOCHA estimates more than 6.4 million people require food assistance in 2022 across all drought-affected areas1, \nincluding 3 million people in Somali Region, 2.4 million in eastern Oromia and 1 million people in southern Oromia. Apart \nfrom the drought, the food security situation of affected populations is further compounded by the COVID19 pandemic \nand persisting locust pests. It should be noted that drought is one of the key factors of the food crisis in the country when \nin the North the Tigray conflict has worsened the situation which is impacting other regions already affected by the \ndrought such as Afar and Oromia as an example. There is a global risk of Famine declaration in the country in the most \naffected localities among the North and South regions. IFRC is implementing an emergency appeal operation covering \nthe complex situation and consequences of the Tigray crisis when in the South, drought is still worsening the needs.  \n \nDrought as a climate challenge is linked to all the other humanitarian challenges raised above and appear like a slow \nonset becoming a high risk to felt on additional humanitarian emergencies in the affected localities and over. The \nEthiopian government through the regional authorities has requested ERCS to support the scale-up of the ongoing \nresponse since the population and needs are alarmingly increasing surpassing the current capacities. Refer to link of \nthe letter dated 10th February 2021: DRMB Letter to ERCS.pdf.  \n \nFor the details of the government of Somali region response plan, please see: Somali Region Drought Response Plan- \nDec 2021 (1) (1).pdf \n \nSummary of the current response  \n \nERCS has a responsibility to provide humanitarian assistance to populations affected by disasters, as enshrined in the \namended charter revised on 26 January 2018 for assisting people affected by natural disasters and conflict throughout \nthe country. The main auxiliary role of ERCS is to supplement the government in the fulfilment of its responsibility to \naddress the vulnerabilities that exist in the country. The Geneva Convention and additional protocol and the International \nHumanitarian Law are other legal bases for Red Cross engagement in such kind of humanitarian interventions being \nimpartial, neutral and independent as outlined in its Fundamental Principles. ERCS is a key national humanitarian actor \nand is present in all the regions of Ethiopia through its network of branches and 44,138 volunteers, including 215 staff \nand volunteers trained in CVA. 5 million members and 6,000 Red Cross committees at the community level. ERCS has \nrepresentation by regional and zonal branches for a total of 11 regions and 37 branches.  \n \nAt the National Headquarters (NHQ), through the Deputy Secretary-General (DGF) for programs, operations are led by \na competent technical team in the disaster preparedness and response department. ERCS has 16 trained National \nDisaster Response Teams (NDRTs) and 229 Branch Disaster Response Teams (BDRTs). ERCS` auxiliary status \nensures that ERCS can move faster and reach areas that are relatively sensitive and where other humanitarian actors \ncannot easily access. ERCS has been privileged by its local network and acceptance by communities and has not been \nlimited in terms of access across the entirety of affected regions Ethiopia. \n \nERCS has the structural, skills and systemic capacities to implement the proposed food security DREF operation with \nthe support of IFRC. ERCS, in the past two years, has successfully implemented/implemented in collaboration with IFR \nthree Emergency Appeals: COVID-19, Tigray Crisis  Population Movement Complex Emergency, and Locust invasion \nand three DREF operations (Civil unrest in Oromia, Floods in Amhara South, Election Preparedness and food security \nin Amhara). It is recently one of the approved pilot countries for the Early Action Protocol (EAP) for floods. Moreover, \nERCS is one of the first National Societies to be validated for Working With Project Partners (WWPP) funds transfer \nfunding mechanism after rigorous assessments and capacity development by IFRC and reportedly one of the most \nsuccessful in the application of the modality.  \n \n1 https://reliefweb.int/report/ethiopia/ethiopia-humanitarian-bulletin-3-january-2022  \nP a g e  | 3 \n \n \n \n \n \nPublic \n \nERCS maintains equal, independent, and neutral responsibility to reach all in needs in all parts of the country; and has \nbeen called upon in its position as an auxiliary by its Government to scale up in collaboration with other Movement \npartners its immediate support to communities experiencing food insecurity across Ethiopia.  \n \nThe table below presents the initial responses and achievements of ERCS so far before: \n \nRegions \nResponse given  \nNo. of beneficiaries \nreached \nPartner  \nSomali region Jigjig \nzone  \n300 quintals of wheat \nflour and 2,000 litres of \noil \n2,000 people \nERCS \nSomali region and \nOromia region Moyale \n200 quintal wheat flour \nand 1,332 litres of oil \ndistributed \n1,332 \nERCS HQ and Ormia region and Farma \nAfrica \nSomali Region Moyale   \nand Oromia Region \nMoyale \n200 quintal wheat flour \nand 1,332 litres of oil \ndistributed \n1,332  \nERCS HQ and Ormia region and Farma \nAfrica \nOromia region, Borena \nzone \n398 quintal wheat flour \nand 2,655 litres of oil \ndistributed \n2,655 people \nERCS HQ and Oromia region \nOromia region, Dawe \nSerer, Bale \n90 quintal food \n600 people \nERCS and Coalition for Humanity \nSomali and Oromia \nMoyale \nFodder distributed \n600 people \nSwiss Red Cross \nSomali and Oromia \nMoyale \nPurchase \nof \n500 \nquintals of wheat flour \nand 3,335 litres of oil \non process \n3,335 people \nERCS HQ and Moyale branch \nOromia region, \nMedawelabu and Dello \nworedas of Bale \n250 quintals of wheat \nflour and 1,668 litres of \noil \n1,668 people \nERCS HQ and Oromia region branch \n \n \nOverview of Red Cross Red Crescent Movement Actions in-country \n \nIFRC has a cluster delegation presence in Ethiopia which also covers Djibouti which is also adequately supported by \nthe African Region office in Nairobi. The delegation has technical staffing including the Operations manager and PMER \nofficer while it also supports key functions in the National society staffing establishment including the Operations officer, \nPGI coordinator and finance officer. \n \nICRC has a delegation in Addis Abeba and 5 Sub-Delegations (Mekelle, Shire, Nekemte, Jigjiga, Gondar). In addition \nto its specific operations, it supports ERCS in different regions of the country through its annual Cooperation Programme. \nIn response to the drought, ICRC has complemented its livestock vaccination programme with the provision of animal \nfeed for 20,000 vulnerable households affected by the drought. \n \nThere are a significant number of Partners National Societies (PNS) in Ethiopia who also support different projects in \nthe country, including cash preparedness, as well as emergency operations including the Federation wide Ethiopia crisis \nappeal led by IFRC. The in-country PNSs include the Swiss Red Cross, Danish Red Cross, Netherlands Red Cross, \nAustrian Red Cross, German Red Cross, Finish Red Cross and Italian Red Cross. The Canadian and the British Red \nCross are remote active patters to ERCS in the Ethiopia humanitarian movement operation.  \n \nThe Red Cross and Red Crescent (RCRC) Movement have a robust Strengthening Movement Coordination and \nCooperation (SMCC) mechanism and through its operation pillar has an active Emergency operation coordination forum. \nThis forum activated a movement response task team from 1st of February 2022, comprising of technical delegates \nfrom IFRC, Swiss Red Cross, German Red Cross, Netherlands Red Cross and led by ERCS director of \nPrograms/operations. The task team have since then dispatched three teams to carry out a comprehensive assessment \nin three affected regions of Somali and parts of Oromia and SNNPR. The team, as part of its elaborate term of reference, \nwill support ERCS in developing a movement response plan after the assessment. That plan will coordinate and support \nresource mobilization for the response, including the request for a DREF allocation through this plan of action. \n \nP a g e  | 4 \n \n \n \n \n \nPublic \nOverview of non-RCRC actors\u2019 actions in the country \n \nERCS coordinates with the National Disaster Risk Management Commission (NDRMC) in the planning and \nimplementation of emergency response actions; and is a member of the National Operations Centre. ERCS is also part \nof the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT), it is represented in clusters and participates in inter-agency working group \nmeetings for various sectors (Cash, Food Security, Nutrition, ES/NFI, Protection, and Education) NHQ and regional \nlevels, as well as the NDRMC, led national early warning task force and Cash Working Group. Movement Partner focal \npoints are supporting ERCS with engagement in the cluster system. The IFRC Ethiopia and Ethiopia CCD is supporting \nthe Food and Non-Food Security, ES/NFI clusters, and are active members of the National Cash Working Group. \n \nThe humanitarian country team structure in Ethiopia is active with all structures fully engaged because of the protracted \nmulti-hazard crisis in the country in the last few years. UNOCHA and the Government through the NDRM department \nare the lead in the coordination.  \nMultiple numbers international organizations are active in the response to the drought. The coordination by the regional \ngovernment is very robust, all clusters are activated, and their regional government has developed a drought response \nplan mentioned in the first section which also forms the basis of this DREF.  \nFurther assessment will update more on the catalogue of specific engagement of respective organizations in the Region \nand on the active field response in the targeted region.  \n \nNeeds analysis, targeting, scenario planning and risk assessment \n \nNeeds analysis  \nReference to triangulated sources of assessment including the Movement multi-sectoral assessment, Somali Regional \nresponse plan based on the regional level inter-agency assessments, early warning and projection indicators of FEWS \nNET (February to May 2022) and OCHA. update bulletins of the country humanitarian situation of the country, have all \nindicated that the drought is alarming, scaling and ravaging increasing vulnerabilities among the pastoral communities \nin the affected arid climate zone of Ethiopia, Somali region being worst affected by geographical and demographic \nscope.  \nFEWS NET (February-May 2022) projection indicates that the drought-affected Somali and Parts Oromia region will \nprogress to IPC 4 from February a reality being confirmed now (FEWS NET Ethiopia Food Security Outlook 21 to May \n22_Final.pdf). Moreover, UNOCHA (Ethiopia Humanitarian bulletin, 3rd January 2022) postulates that more than 6.4 \nmillion people are estimated to require food assistance in 2022 across all drought-affected areas, including 3 million \npeople in Somali Region, 2.4 million in eastern Oromia and 1 million people in southern Oromia. \n  \nThe worsening trends include deteriorating vegetative conditions, increased distances to water sources, worsening \nlivestock conditions, diminishing productivity of livestock products and low stock prices. At worst post parts of the Somali \nzone, the stock is dying especially goats and cattle with the camels looking weak and exhausted too. The condition is \ncompromising people\u2019s life due to induced food security crisis which makes the affected population susceptible to risks \nof nutritionally related diseases and even death especially among children under five, lactating and pregnant mothers \nand the elderly.    \n \nSummary of ERCs assessment in Somali region : \n\u2022 \n>3 Million people in need, 900,000 people receive daily support through different sectors  \n\u2022 \nMalnutrition: from 813,000 screened 14,000 (1,72%) are SAM and 137,000 (16.8%) are MAM, 32% of pregnant \nand lactating women are moderately malnourished (72,000 women) \n\u2022 \nWASH: 2.28 Million people in 657 sites across 86 woredas require emergency water interventions \n\u2022 \nLivelihood: 683,000 livestock deaths have been reported already \n\u2022 \nIDP\u2019s: 146,297 households are displaced in Somali Region spread over 427 sites - latest info from August 2021 \n(DTM27. Refer to detailed ERCS assessment in Somali region Briefing drought assessment Somali Region.pdf). \n \nKey Basic needs sectors are analysed to guide the response strategy of this DREF based on the information and data \navailable from the different instruments aforementioned  \nFood and livelihood needs  \nThe assessments indicated that food is the priority need. FEWS NET focused indicator of February to May 2022 places \nmost of the region in IPC4. Household food access is expected to remain constrained as staple food prices remain \nabove average and livestock prices are relatively low. As a result, critical nutrition outcomes will persist in children under \nfive years of age. Households are also likely to increase consumption-based coping strategies like reducing the number \nof daily meals, eating less preferred foods, limiting adult intake for children to eat, borrowing food from friends and \nrelatives and sale of more livestock than normal. The current regional response plan appeal for immediate food relief \nP a g e  | 5 \n \n \n \n \n \nPublic \nfor 628,744 persons a number that is progressively increasing as the drought scales up and more populations drop from \nthe pastoral livelihood.  \nThe lack of pasture for the livestock, which is the main livelihood of the affected pastoral communities, is resulting in \nemaciated body condition of the animals, exhaustion, and eventual death. Those with large stock are making all effort \nto sustain their stock including the desperate cooping option of migration which also due to the long stretch is increasing \nexhaustion level of weak animals to succumb. Others with small stock are trying to feed their livestock sometimes \nsharing with them what the family had for domestic sustenance. This is another desperate undertaking that also \ncompromises the family\u2019s nutrition. \nIn the practical observation of such needs, provision of livestock feeds for the milking lactating stock in the villages can \nbe an expensive undertaking but ideal to save the stock and increase milk production to contribute to the children's \nnutrition requirement which is now depriving them by feeding with them. In the alternative, home stock feeding initiative, \nthe children are also tasked to do a collection of food remains and grass in the forest and any hidden under the woods. \nThis is another child labouring at the expense of school which also increases their exhaustion and malnutrition levels.     \nWater Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) needs: \nFailure of the two rainy seasons has resulted in extreme water shortage, migration of pastoral communities and \nwidespread reliance on water trucking. High-water prices have been reported in most pastoral and agro-pastoral \nlivelihood zones. With the movement of livestock to strategic water points and limited access to productive land for \nfarming and grazing, there is already increasing local tensions which could trigger further inter-communal conflict as a \nresult of inward migration and survival competition thereof for pasture and water. The cost of water has increased in \nsome areas by 60 % during the critical drought period. There is an increase in distance to household water sources \nbecause of the drying water sources. \nThe regional inter-agency assessment report states that a population of 2,279,609 people have constrained access to \nwater and need water trucking intervention in 657 sites across 86 woredas in the Somali region. Water needs are also \nimpacting community services, including health facilities, leading to closures which further exacerbates the wellbeing of \nthe affected population.    \nThe few sustainable water sources are under pressure with huge human population and livestock population due to the \ninward migration when the sub-surface water sources are depleted. This result in increased running hours of the \nborehole pumps, hence frequent breakdowns and high cost of maintenance. There is need to support and \nmaintain/sustain the operation of these lifeline water sources. \nThe table below captured from the Somali region assessment from Regional interagency Assessment reflects the level \nof water stress with half of the water sources not functional: \n \n \nHealth and Nutrition needs:  \nThe drought had a direct effect on the health sector, with some facilities completely closed due to lack of water and \nmigration of the population in search of water and pasture for their livestock as cited by the regional seasonal \nP a g e  | 6 \n \n \n \n \n \nPublic \nassessment. Water scarcity increases the risk of susceptibility of water and hygiene borne diseases like cholera, acute \nwatery diarrhoea, scabies, etc.  \nMalnutrition related ailments is another hazard as a result of the drought due to the low nutritional level. The drivers of \nacute malnutrition include reduced livestock productivity, reduced milk consumption, poor infant and young child feeding \npractices, poor hygiene and sanitation, stock-outs for essential commodities for the management of acute malnutrition \nand other morbidities.  \nA nutritional screening conducted by the Regional Health Bureau across Somali Region in December 2021 revealed a \nproxy Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) rate of 18 per cent, higher than the global threshold of 15 per cent. Some \n225,000 malnourished children and over 100,000 pregnant and breastfeeding women in Somali and Oromia currently \nneed nutrition support according to UNICEF2.  \n \nProtection needs \nWomen and girls in areas affected by drought face the risk of multiple forms of gender-based violence (GBV), including \nsexual violence, intimate partner violence and forced marriages. Other vulnerable groups include people living with HIV, \npeople living with disabilities, children under five, pregnant and lactating mothers among others. The emergency has \nalso placed an additional burden on women in terms of responsibilities around household food consumption, water \ncollection and household care responsibilities, which expose them to greater risks. \nA recent assessment by ERCS has revealed that women track long distances for water and wait more than 8 hours in \nwater points due to congestion, the assessment further noted that after this stressful day some collapsed on the way \ndue to hunger and fatigue.  \nOlder men and women have to cover greater distances to find food, firewood and water for themselves and their \nfamilies. With entire communities affected, traditional support networks are unable to cope. Older people are left isolated \nand in need, causing great emotional distress. \n \nTargeting \n \nIn terms of geographical targeting, this DREF operation will target the Somali region and Oromia (Moyale and Boran \nzones). The specific location will be determined by the Branch in consultation with the regional government and other \nhumanitarian actors in the regional level coordination forum. A total of 50,0000 people of the most vulnerable households \nwill be assisted in the multisectoral support, including 3000HH (15,000 people )  targeted with multipurpose cash \nassistance. \n \nPriority will be given to support economically vulnerable households (living under MEB) who are most affected by the \ndrought with no alternative coping strategies, as guided by standard humanitarian practices and any other localised \ncommunity standards and within customs - with specific consideration within this group for: \n  \ni) \nHouseholds with either pregnant and lactating mothers and/or under-five children, \nii) Household with nursing aged persons, and/or persons terminally ill with HIV/AIDS or other similar diseases, \niii) Households that contain orphans, elderly people, people with disabilities, \niv) Household with single mothers or are child-headed \nv) Households with social protection needs.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2 Ethiopia_ Drought Update No. 1, January 2022 - Ethiopia _ ReliefWeb.html \n \nP a g e  | 7 \n \n \n \n \n \nPublic \n \nEstimated disaggregated data for population targeted. \n \nCategory \nEstimated % \nof target group \n% female \n% male \nYoung Children (under 5 years) \n30% \n13% \n12% \nChildren (5-17yrs) \n20% \n11% \n9% \nAdults (18-49 yrs) \n45% \n35% \n10% \nElderly (>50 yrs) \n10% \n6% \n4% \nTotal \n100% \n55% \n45% \nPeople with disabilities \n12% \nunknown \nunknown \n \n \n \nScenario planning  \n \nScenario \nHumanitarian consequence \nPotential Response \nScenario \n1: \nFood \nsecurity \nshocks \nare \nbeyond \ncommunity \nmeans \nand \nstressed \nwater access levels \n\u2022 \nTarget areas receive below-average \nrainfall - with low crop yield and reduced \npasture regeneration. \n Longer dry spells  \n\u2022 \nHigh food prices in the local markets  \n\u2022 \n Increased cases of malnutrition among \nthe affected population \n\u2022 \n Increase in water shortage  \n\u2022 \nStressed phase classification  \n\u2022 \nare in IPC 3. \n\u2022 \nGovernment and Somali regional actors \nare providing initial response  \n\u2022 \nMonitor the rains and support WASH and \nlivelihood initiatives.

The target Somali region shares a border with the Oromo and Afar Regions and internally with Kenya, Somalia \nand Djibouti. The pastoral communities\u2019 migratory trends in search of pasture and water make them cross borders in \nwhich case there is often resource-based ethnic conflict with neighbours. In the long stretch Somalia border risk \ninfiltration of AL-Shabab, armed militant group although the government security apparatus is aware, vigilant and in \ncontrol. \nOromia Region \nProtests and demonstrations occur periodically in a range of towns across the Oromia region. Towns in the Wollega and \nShewa Zones, and West Arsi Zone, including Ambo, Wolissa, Nekemte and Shashemene, have been particularly \naffected. Demonstrations have also been witnessed elsewhere including in the Bale Zone to the south-east. Some \nprotests have turned violent and resulted in casualties; others caused severe disruption to road travel including major \nroads to and from Addis Ababa. There is a threat of kidnapping in western areas of Oromia, particularly West Wollega, \nEast Wollega and Qellem Wollega Zones. Recent kidnaps have targeted the mining industry. Towns in the Wollega and \nShewa Zones, and West Arsi Zone, including Ambo, Wolissa, Nekemte and Shashemene, have been particularly \naffected.  \nSouthern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region (SNNPR) \nThere have been some instances of civil unrest in towns in the Sidama Zone, including Hawassa, and clashes along \nstretches of the internal border with the Oromia region, especially in the Gedeo Zone. Whilst such disturbances have \nbeen less frequent than in several other areas of Ethiopia, a number have turned violent at short notice. \nSomali Region \nThere is local instability, lawlessness, military activity, and general risk of banditry in the Somali Region. Since the mid-\n1990s, insurgent groups, some affiliated with militant organizations, have clashed with government forces. There have \nalso been attacks on staff working for international NGOs. \n \nMoreover, ERCS has invested heavily in security including technical capacities and Standard Operating Procedures \n(SOPs).  In addition, due diligence for the safety of staff will be taken utmost and the following specific actions will be \npart of the routine:  \n\u2022 \nCommunity engagement and conflict-sensitive approach strengthened through observance of Red Cross \nmovement fundamental principles, and   \n\u2022 \nThe community feedback data can also be monitored regularly for comments that may indicate a threat to \nstaff and volunteers and relayed to security focal points \n\u2022 \nRespect of visibility through the wearing of jackets and regular communication on all the movements. \n\u2022 \nRegular briefings will be organized to remind volunteers and staff of their behaviour and Safer Access. \n\u2022 \nCoordination will be maintained between the ERCS and IFRC to ensure that all security measures are \nrespected. \n\u2022 \nCarry out periodic and need-based security assessments to inform the security strategies. \n\u2022 \nConstant communication check-in measures with base by all operation staff will be sustained and \ncommunication to communities around the objectives of this assistance. \n\u2022 \nImplement the ERCS CVA risk analysis and mitigation measures, especially around the safety of affected \npopulations \n \n \nCOVID-19 pandemic: This operation and its operational strategy consider the risks related to the current COVID-19 \npandemic and is aligned with the IFRC Global COVID-19 Emergency Appeal that supports National Societies to deliver \nassistance and support to communities affected or at risk of being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to \nthe Ministry of Health of Ethiopia as of 5th December  of February 2022, a total of 466,455 COVID 19 cases had been \nregistered with 400,734 recoveries and  7,356 deaths in total lab tests of 4,382,926  persons  in Ethiopia with a total \nvaccinated of  9,372,107 \nTo date, the following measures have been taken to curb the spread of the disease: mandatory mask-wearing, \nhandwashing stations, using soap and water or alcohol hand rubs, setting up of COVID-19 screening sites, setting up \nof testing and treatment centres; advocating with available risk communication resources, providing updated information \nregularly on the evolving COVID-19 situation. ERCS responses to COVID-19 are supported through the IFRC Global \nP a g e  | 9 \n \n \n \n \n \nPublic \nCOVID-19 Emergency Appeal, which is facilitating and supporting them to maintain critical service provision while \nadapting to the COVID-19 situation. ERCS operation is aligned with and will contribute to the current global strategy and \nregional Emergency Plan of Action (4th Revision) for COVID-19 developed by the IFRC Africa Regional Office, in \ncoordination with global and regional partners.  \nEthiopia Red Cross has recently developed with support from the IFRC COVID-19 vaccine plan and consequently \nacquired extra logistical support through IFRC funding to increase its capacity to support mass vaccine uptake in the \ncountry. ERCS is in a consortium of national societies receiving funding for COVID19 vaccine operation from the global \nAfrica- CDC and IFRC partnership on COVID19 Vaccine \n IFRC continues to assess how emergency operations in response to disasters and crises should adapt to this crisis \nand provide necessary guidance to its membership on the same and the NS will ensure COVID-19 prevention measures \nare mainstreamed in all operations to deal with exceptional needs of affected communities as a result of the emergency. \nERCS will keep monitoring the situation closely and revise the plan accordingly if needed, taking into consideration the \nevolving COVID-19 situation and the operational risks that might develop, including operational challenges related to \naccess to the affected population, availability of cash and livelihoods items, procurement issues, and movement of \nERCS volunteers and staff as well as international staff. For more information, please consult the COVID-19 Operations \nPage on the IFRC Go platform.  \n \n \nB. Operational strategy3 \n \nOverall objectives: Support 50,000 people of the drought-affected population in the Somali region, and Moyale and \nBoran zones of the Oromia region, through a 6-month multisectoral intervention. \n \nProposed Strategy: ERCS will focus on the most vulnerable people in the targeted regions. With a Priority being given \nto support economically vulnerable households who are most affected by the drought with no alternative coping \nstrategies, as guided by standard humanitarian practices and with no overlapping assistance. The assistance will cover \nbasic needs of livelihood/food, Wash and health services with a protection and community engagement approach in the \nspecific migration and security context.  Per sectors, the proposed intervention will be as follow:  \n \nOperational learning to be considered in this response: \nERCS operational learning from past intervention will serve to complement the actual response. The following point will \nbe considered in this strategy: A close follow-up with IFRC support must be put in place to ensure procurement is \ncomplete in the time of the operation. Considering the delay observed in previous interventions that led to extensions, \nERCS is planning the intervention for an extended implementation period of 6 months directly. In addition, regarding \nlessons learnt from the previous Food insecurity DREF MDRET026, although the projects were all completed, the needs \nof communities have increased or are constantly complexified by conflicts. In the previous DREF MDRET026 food \nsecurity, the implementation was closely follow-up and completed. However, these communities were later affected by \nconflict in the third wave of escalation when war came close to Addis Ababa. a situation that was not foreseen because \nthe project was implemented in that range.  \nEthiopian Red Cross Society (ERCS) has 37 branches across the country and 5,000 active volunteers supporting the \nmultiple interventions on which NS is taken part with IFRC and other partners. The NS has sufficient resources to lead \nmultiple large-scale operations. And ERCS will also ensure required staff and volunteers are mobilised without impinging \non ongoing operations.  \nERCS in the past two years has considerably strengthened its capacity in Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA) \nprogramming. NS has also good operational experience on this type of crisis and intervention in collaboration with IFRC \non multiple Emergency Appeals and DREF. It delivers 90% of its interventions through cash and is used by all the \npartners and so far, it has been an efficient and transparent process. In the last series of coordination meetings scaling \ncapacities in the regions with cash, experts were raised subject to resources. For this operation, a surge cash expert \nwill also provide additional technical support to complete this intervention.  \n \n \n \n \n3 The plan should be prepared by the National Society, with support from the Secretariat technical departments and support services. \nP a g e  | 10 \n \n \n \n \n \nPublic \nBasic Needs and Livelihoods: target is 15,000 people \nThe intervention will ensure that access to food for the affected population is not further compromised, nor the nutritional \nstatus of the most vulnerable such as children aged under five years old, lactating, pregnant mothers, the elderly and \nthose living with a disability.  \nERCS has also considerably strengthened its capacity in Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA) programming as a \nresponse option. It has an established Financial Service Provider (FSP), the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, which has \nenabled it to reach populations across the country with CVA programming and has an appointed CVA focal point. Cash \nfeasibility and risk assessments have been conducted in most regions of the country \u2013 and it presents a viable option \nfor ERCS to efficiently address the multitude of needs, including immediate household food insecurity, that is emerging \nacross Ethiopia. Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (FSP), which is the largest bank network in the country, has branches in \nall zones and is accessible to affected populations at inconvenient distances. Since the disbursement modality is through \na targeted beneficiary individual account, the cash transfer is safe, confidential and a free service both for ERCS and \nthe beneficiary. In the service provider agreement, the bank provides the service as a humanitarian compliment from its \ncooperate responsibility and charges no cost on ERCS nor the targeting population nor does these beneficiary accounts \nhave any limits or conditions including account maintenance balance or transaction charges. This applies only to ERCS \nhumanitarian services \nMultipurpose cash transfers will be used as a short-term lifesaving mechanism to deliver this strategy through criteria-\nbased targeting. Cash will be delivered using the ERCS\u2019 existing Financial Service Provider (FSP) - Commercial Bank \nof Ethiopia through direct recipient bank accounts. However, where the bank is not accessible ERCS will procure \nalternative service providers feasible in the region through standard IFRC guidelines following IFRC compliance. ERCS \nwill provide sensitization on the process of targeting, registration, account opening and access to cash, to targeted \nhouseholds. \nTargeted families will receive one instalment of ETB 6,000 cash assistance per household based on the minimum \nexpenditure basket (MEB). The MEB is derived from cash feasibility and market assessment carried out by ERCS and \nis harmonised with the transfer value used by other humanitarian actors, which covers basic food and non-food items. \nThe amount is only an indicative average of what is in the minimum need and what actors are given as assistance. \nMarket price and Households needs will be triangulated before distribution at the same time of beneficiary identification \nand registration. \nVolunteers will be trained in CVA and related CEA requirements and will be subsequently engaged to facilitate the \ndelivery processes of the cash assistance. Alongside cash activities, ERCS will engage affected populations on \ncomplementary activities that support the utilisation of the cash received; this includes nutritional awareness, discussions \non management of cash for example through sensitisation sessions with both women and men on the cash benefitting \nthe entire household, ensuring that volunteers are aware of referral mechanisms between humanitarian organizations \nas well as public services and know-how to make safe and confidential referrals (e.g. to SGBV case management, \nhealth, child protection, malnutrition and therapeutic care centres etc.). In addition, a surge with cash and voucher \nassistance profile will be deployed to follow up this process closely. \nERCS as part of the operation activities will conduct Post distribution monitoring (PDM) and market monitoring to assess \nthe relevance, acceptance and effects of the response which will also inform feedback and as lessons for future \nprogramming.  \n \nWater Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH): target is 50,000 people \nWASH needs were cited by all assessments as a priority. Most water sources have dried and there is heavy reliance on \nthe boreholes which are also experiencing exhaustion and frequent breakdowns. Water assessment in the Moyale and \nBoran zones reflected that water costs for a 20lt gallon increased 20-40 ETB depending on the distance:  \nThe proposed WASH sector intervention strategies include:  \n\u2022 \nProvision of HH water storage containers (jerrican 20 l)  \n\u2022 \nWater treatment tablets  \n\u2022 \nBoreholes operations maintenance through the supply of fast-moving servicing parts and replaceable items  \n\u2022 \nTraining volunteers on hygiene promotion  \n\u2022 \nSafe disposal of livestock carcasses at water points and homesteads  \n\u2022 \nHygiene promotion and sensitisation on the use of wash material with IEC material printing \n\u2022 \nDignity kit distribution to women of childbearing age. \n \n \n \nP a g e  | 11 \n \n \n \n \n \nPublic \nHealth and Nutrition: target is 50,000 people \nConduct community MHPSS sessions, engaging local associations and community platforms including religious and \neducation stakeholders. This will be psychosocial First Aid (PFA) done through group and individual one on one sessions \nbased on needs identified by professional PFA providers.  \nSensitize community Health Volunteers on nutrition surveillance through the family MUAC approach. Training and \nsensitization of 30 caregivers on family MUAC and referrals and equip them with the screening materials. \nContinuous nutritional surveillance and screening of under-fives, pregnant and lactating mothers and sensitizing the \ncommunity for linkage to care facilities for proper management of the nutrition care and support pathway. In the event \nthe acute malnutrition levels surge with the increased caseload, ERCS can partner with the Ministry of Health or any \nother health and nutrition expert NGO providing facility-level clinical and therapeutic care to adequately provide social \nmobilization, community awareness and linkage to care facilities. \n \nProtection, Gender, and Inclusion (PGI)  \nFood insecurity is the primary effect of drought emergency as reflected in all the different progressive assessments \ncarried out and food insecurity is a driver of protection issues that results in negative coping strategies including child \nlabour, child marriages, sexual and gender-based violence, trafficking, sexual exploitation, and abuse. \nPGI will therefore be mainstreamed throughout this intervention to ensure communities' dignity, access, participation, \nand safety. As part of the need\u2019s assessment and analysis, a gender, protection and diversity analysis have been in \nassessment and will continue to understand and respond to individuals and groups in the affected community, based \non their specific risks, needs and concerns. And will inform the operational strategies. IFRC is supporting through the \nMDRTIGRAY Emergency Appeal the recruitment position of PGI coordinator which will oversee and technically support \nrelative activities in this DREF.  \nAcknowledging that women, girls, men and boys with diverse ages, disabilities and backgrounds have very different \nneeds, risks and coping strategies, there is a need to: \n\u2022 \nConduct PGI assessment in the targeted area \n\u2022 \nEquip staff and volunteers with skills and knowledge on PGI, with more emphasis on the practical application \nof the PGI minimum standards (Dignity, Access, Participation and Safety) \n\u2022 \nInclude SGBV messages and awareness including safe referral pathways in community sensitisation \nsessions \n\u2022 \nEnsuring all staff and volunteers in this operation receive briefings on Protection of sexual exploitation and \nabuse (PSEA) and code of conduct and they sign the code of conduct \n\u2022 \nCollection and analysis of Sex, age, and disability disaggregated data (SADDD) in ERCS operations. \n\u2022 \nIntegrating PGI in assessments and ensuring a gender and diversity analysis guides the operational strategy. \n\u2022 \nProvide dignity kits for vulnerable women and adolescent girls  \n\u2022 \nCoordinating with CEA in the handling of sensitive complaints in community feedback and response systems \n\u2022 \nEnsure PGI is integrated in all sectors \n\u2022 \nIn engaging with communities ensure gender and diversity is factored in and that women, persons with \ndisabilities, youth, children are engaged at all levels in the response. \n \nCommunity Engagement and Accountability (CEA):  \nCEA will be integrated into the response interventions to ensure the engagement and involvement of all stakeholders \nincluding the community members of the affected populations. Communities will be consulted at all stages of the \nresponse and be given opportunities to participate in and influence operational and programme decisions. In addition, \ntwo-way information sharing approaches will be used to inform community members about the operation including the \nselection criteria, distribution processes, participation/dialogue platforms, etc. This will be completed as part of the \npreparedness/set-up activity across the branches involved in the implementation of this DREF; and may include \nplatforms such as community meetings, radio shows and/or social media depending on what the preferred and trusted \ncommunication channels of the communities are as well as their appropriateness to the context in the respective area.  \n \nCommunity feedback and response systems will be established to listen to people\u2019s feedback, questions, and concerns \nabout the response and the data will be analysed and discussed with communities to understand where improvements \nneed to be made. Communities will be made aware of the established ERCS feedback system, how to use it as well as \nthe role of the volunteers in the feedback system. The community will also be supported in the establishment of \ncommunity feedback committees for reliable and swift relay of information, feedback, and complaints. Sensitive feedback \nwill be handled through the referral pathways highlighted in the ERCS PSEA policy. Communication and dissemination \nof Fundamental Principles will be a component of the CEA activities to ensure access and acceptance. To ensure the \nP a g e  | 12 \n \n \n \n \n \nPublic \neffective integration of CEA and accountability of the response, staff and volunteers will receive training on CEA and \ncommunity feedback systems \n \nFor all intervention strategies of this DREF, the ERCS will ensure coordination with Government authorities at all levels, \nrelevant stakeholders and thematic clusters to ensure complementarity, transparency and coordination. As noted, ERCS \nwill conduct a PDM of the cash disbursement and will conduct a lesson learnt workshop for reflective learning and \nimproving on future programming.  \n \nExit strategy  \nAcknowledging that funding from DREF is for immediate response during an emergency thus the operations it supports \nfocus on immediate life-saving interventions.  \nThe scale of the drought and the needs raised by the assessment will require a bigger response in terms of scope and \ntime. In this respect, this DREF will be upgraded to an emergency appeal for wider coverage by geography and \ndemographic targeting and to address early recovery and rehabilitation needs to strengthen resilience and preparedness \ncapacities  \nERCS will carry out advocacy and popularise the impact of the project to attract potential partners including ECHO, UN \nbodies and other multi-lateral agencies and within the RCRC Movement, in a bid to highlight the silent food crisis \naffecting communities outside of those directly affected by the Tigray crisis and in alignment with the Pan African Zero \nHunger Initiative 2021-2030 through sustainable medium- long-term solutions to address the risks of hunger in Ethiopia. \nA launch of an Emergency appeal covering the most affected countries is in line with this perspective.  \nERCS and IFRC will work to ensure that there is the transfer of competencies on the lesson learnt following project \nimplementation, to ensure the sustainability of the impact on the community and to document a larger response to be \nlaunched. The Ethiopia complex crisis appeal and the food security drought response will eventually converge towards \nan Ethiopia-wide recovery and resilience strategy.  \n \nOperational support services \n\u27a2 Planning, Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting (PMER)  \nEmphasis is made on encouraging continuous assessment of the situation, monitoring of the services being provided \nas well as looking at monitoring of the feedback from beneficiaries. Analysis of monitoring data and reports will be used \nfor decision-making and continuous improvement of the implementation. Attention will be paid to data management, \ninclusive of the collection of disaggregated beneficiary data, storage, and analysis.  \nPost-distribution monitoring is planned, and a lesson learn to get the achieved results to assess and have operational \nlearning that will document the potential scaled up of this operation or any planned operation on Drought related issue. \nContinuous communication with the field teams, along with the issuance of necessary updates of the operation including \nthe final report will be managed accordingly. The IFRC Operations Manager based in Addis Ababa will work with the \nERCS team to ensure monitoring of the operation for quality, quantity, scope, and quantity as well as transparency and \naccountability in its delivery. \n\u27a2 Human Resources  \nERCS human resources involved in the operation include 100 volunteers engaged in distinct functions in WASH CEA; \nPGI the implementation of the operation will be supported by the ERCS respective branches in the regions of Somali \nand Oromia. The regional programs coordinator will also oversee the implementation and will be supported from national \nheadquarters (NHQ) by the focal operations coordinator delegated from the Disaster Preparedness and Response \n(DPR) team by the director of programs. The National society's systemic capacities, staffing and volunteer capacities \nand network is an asset to the operation. Any gaps will be resourced by the operation. Most importantly focal response \ntechnical coordinators could be considered in each region. \nIFRC surge field officer cash expert will be deployed to support locally the implementation of the operation for 3 months. \n\u27a2 Finance and administration \nFinancial resources will be safeguarded by high quality financial and administrative practices supported and monitored \nby ERCS and IFRC finance staff at national and regional levels. Compliance with IFRC logistics and financial procedures \nwill be observed and continuous monitoring and technical support will be provided by IFRC to ensure agreed standards \nare met. ERCS is on funds transfer modality and IFRC Finance officers in the AU- delegation in the country will conduct \nspot checks for the operation as per the framework agreements and the WWPP funds transfer modality requirements. \n \nP a g e  | 13 \n \n \n \n \n \nPublic \n\u27a2 Logistics and Procurement management  \nLocal procurement will be carried out for all material requirements like PPEs, IEC and/or visibility of the operation within \nthe National Society\u2019s threshold of the WWPP framework following the IFRC standard procurement procedures. \nProcurement processes will be administered by ERCS HQ and the IFRC Operations manager will support the \ncompliance process. For the cash to be disbursed for food assistance, ERCS will conduct the market and cash feasibility \nassessment to determine the mode of delivery (cash or voucher). ERCS has a pre-existing agreement with financial \nservice provider Commercial bank of Ethiopia for provision services.  \n \n\u27a2 Communications  \nERCS will regularly share information and updates on the operation via a range of communications channels and the \nSecretary-General will be the primary spokesperson for communications to external stakeholders within Ethiopia. IFRC \nwill support the ERCS communications team to communicate with external audiences with a focus on food security and \nthe Red Cross humanitarian action assisting people affected by disasters. The communications will generate visibility \nand provide advocacy for both humanitarian and sustainable support in the food security sector.  ERCS will ensure close \ntechnical collaboration with the IFRC African regional communications unit for a coherent and coordinated \ncommunications approach.  \n\u27a2 Security  \nThe security situation in the country at large because of the fighting in different regions is fluid. However, since the onset \nof the Tigray crisis the ERCS in collaboration with the PNS have invested capacity in security.  The operational area \nsupported by the DREF is a considerable distance from Tigray and areas of Afar and Amhara where there has been a \nspillover of violence.   \nSecurity coordination is an integral part of the coordination of partners and through the different coordination platforms.  \nAdvisory support will be sought through this forum; as well as in coordination with the IFRC security officer in Ethiopia; \nand proactive measures will be taken to ensure that the operation is not adversely affected and or for timely re- strategy \nin the event of any recurrence. \nTo reduce the risk of personnel falling victim to crime, violence or road hazards active risk mitigation measures must be \nadopted. This includes situation monitoring and implementation of minimum-security standards. IFRC security plans will \napply to all IFRC personnel throughout.  All RCRC personnel actively involved in the operations must have completed \nthe respective IFRC security e-learning courses (i.e., Stay Safe Level 1 Fundamentals, Level 2 Personal and Volunteer \nSecurity in emergencies, Level 3 Security for Managers).   \n \n \nP a g e  | 14 \n \n \n \n \n \nPublic \nC.

SITUATION ANALYSIS \n \nDescription of the disaster \n \nOverall Drought Situation in Iran: \nThe Iranian climate is mostly arid or semi-arid and it is heavily affected by depleting water resources, as a result of rising \ndemand, salinization, groundwaters overexploitation, and increasing drought frequency. The country, where \ngroundwater is the primary source of water, has a long history of inefficiency in its water distribution network, particularly \nin the agricultural sector. Despite not experiencing food insecurity, Iran faces paramount challenges in safeguarding \nlong-term water access during the dry spell. All sectors that rely on the water are exposed, from agriculture to power \nproduction and public water supply. Currently, from 2 to 20 million people are at high to medium risk of drought-related \nimpacts. On top of poor precipitation during the 2020-2021 winter, high temperatures have caused more snow to melt, \nreducing the amount of water stored for later use during the drier months (i.e., late spring and summer). \n \nSince the beginning of the drought onset, research units, the media, and public authorities have been emphasizing the \npotential severity with time. On 10 July 2021, the First Vice President of Iran, Eshaq Jahangiri stressed that the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran requires national solidarity and integration to overcome challenges and to pass crises. He described \nEmergency Plan of Action (EPoA) \nIRAN: Droughts \n \n \n \nP a g e  | 2 \n \n \n \nRestricted \nwater as one of the biggest problems in Iran, saying \u201cif we cannot deal with challenges in time, they can become \ncomplicated issues\u201d.  \n \nWhile meteorological/hydrological droughts act as triggers and intensify the rate of depletion in country-wide \ngroundwater storage, basin-scale groundwater depletion in Iran is primarily caused by extensive human water \nwithdrawals. Continuation of unsustainable groundwater management in Iran can lead to potentially irreversible effects \non land and the environment, threatening the country\u2019s water, food, and socio-economic security. \n \nLong-term records show that the entire area received no meaningful precipitation between June and October 2020, with \nvery little variation around this figure. As a result, the accumulated deficit up to May 2021 will persist until the end of the \nyear, potentially worsening and spreading drought impacts throughout the region in the coming months. \n \n \nFigure 1: Iran affected by long-term drought. Credit: IRCS \n \nSummary of the current response  \n \nOverview of Operating National Society  \nOver the last ten years, the Iranian Red Crescent Society (IRCS) has focused its efforts on providing more sustainable \nwater resources for villagers through the establishment of water reservoirs, providing services and social support to \nvulnerable groups as well as distributing safe drinking water, health items, and livelihood packages among the vulnerable \ngroups, especially the women-headed household and patients. \n \nThe IRCS is conducting a national initiative titled \"Water Donation,\" which began three years ago. When the drought hit \nthe country\u2019s southern and south-eastern provinces, the IRCS decided to launch the project with the aim of providing \ndrinking water in remote areas. The current DREF will address mainly the severity which triggered high vulnerability and \nscaled up basic needs like livelihoods, health, sustaining, and making water available at a fast pace. Water donation \nproject is more of recovery and sustaining the infrastructure or rehabilitation, but DREF will contribute to meet the basic \nneeds which (continuous) four years of drought (in the area) has disturbed, and the current situation further worsened.  \n \nThe project is divided into three phases: providing livelihood assistance, medical services, and addressing water scarcity \nby putting efforts for the availability of water to communities, water purification systems, and plumbing in underdeveloped \nareas so that the population has access to safe drinking water. In four drought-affected provinces, like Sistan and \nBaluchestan, South Khorasan, Kerman, and Hormozgan, IRCS volunteers provided guidance, support, skills, and \nparticipation. \n \nMore services are to be provided by the IRCS, such as free home visits by volunteer physicians, distribution of livelihood \npackages, and cash and in-kind donations to drought-affected people.   \n \nOverall, the current DREF is complementary to the activities and actions already being implemented by IRCS to respond \nto the needs of those populations most affected by the drought.  \n \n \n \nP a g e  | 3 \n \n \n \nRestricted \nOverview of Red Cross Red Crescent Movement Actions in-country \nThe IFRC has a presence in Iran since 1991 and has been providing technical support in Capacity Building initiatives \nand supporting IRCS in Disaster Management, Shelter, Disaster Law, Youth, and volunteers as well as Health. There \nis no partner National Societies (PNS) present in the country; however, IRCS has a memorandum of understanding with \nthe German Red Cross (search and rescue sniffer dogs action, peer-to-peer exchange). The International Committee \nof the Red Cross (ICRC) has a delegation based in Tehran with a various number of humanitarian activities in \ncooperation with the IRCS and is on standby to support the IRCS operation (e.g. through health support to migrants, \nMine Risk Education and Restoring Family Links). \n \nOverview of other actors\u2019 actions in-country \n \nGovernmental and Legal Actions to control drought and its impact: According to the act of parliament, IRCS is the \nnational lead for any disaster/crisis response in the country. Once the situation needs crisis response, it is IRCS who is \nsupported by law to lead, even concerned ministries are bound to cooperate with IRCS as the lead in specific \ncrisis/disaster response modes. At the NDMO level, the convener of relief response is IRCS. All UN/INGOs/NGOs have \nto work under the IRCS role and mandate for initial response.  \nWater supply sustainability, storage capacity expansion, demand management, urban water waste reduction, water \npurification, facility resilience, and the number of people using sewage disposal services are among the actions taken \nby the government to control the drought. The government has put in place a plan to transport water from the Oman \nSea and the Persian Gulf to the southern provinces including Yazd, Kerman, and Hormozgan. This project solely \nsatisfies the needs of copper and iron factories; it cannot offer drinking water because desalination is a complicated \nprocess that necessitates expensive modern equipment. Another government initiative is the construction of stone and \ncement dams in cities such as Jiroft, Bam, and Nisa.  \nThe Welfare Organization and the Imam Khomeini Relief Committee provide a variety of services including communities' \nsocial health and better living. \n \nNeeds analysis, targeting, scenario planning and risk assessment \n \nNeeds analysis  \nThe effects of the drought in recent years have had a significant impact on various aspects of the province's \ndevelopment, people's lives, and basic resources. Water scarcity has resulted in a reduction in Minab, Jegin, and Shamil \ndams. Severe reduction in groundwater level in the province\u2019s main plains, salinization, and reduced quality of \ngroundwater resources due to improper abstraction, is resulting in: \n \n1. Decreasing the areas under cultivation and livestock and poultry population.  \n2. Reducing the number of agricultural products and depending on water import. \n3. Reducing discharge and drying out water resources such as wells and flumes.  \n4. Decreasing food products and increasing the price of food items. \n5. Decreasing employment, income, and its social and economic consequences.   \n6. Increasing and subsidence and soil erosion and its consequences. \n7. Reducing the quality of life for border residents and problems of borders security maintain.  \n8. Putting family security, hygiene, and health at risk. \n9. Increasing the negative impact on the COVID-19 situation and operation.  \n10. Increasing the migration from villages to towns. \n11. Increasing tension among those who benefit from water resources. \n \nTargeted provinces are going through serious multiple crises like red coding in COVID-19, droughts severity, and \npossible Afghan refugee\u2019s influx operations will take place in these eastern bordering provinces.  \n \nDue to depletion of resources (sanctions suffocation), the pressure of scaling up with agility and ensuring the \ncontinuation of mandated public services in crisis/natural disasters, expectations of stakeholders from IRCS in these \ndire multiple crisis times, the sensitivity of the bordering provinces with Pakistan/Afghanistan (IRCS access/acceptance \nbeing only biggest well-rooted national set up), all these domains are compelling to launch DREF progressing to \nEmergency Appeal. IFRC is expected to play the added value role by offering tools/resources to support the \nhumanitarian action of IRCS.  \n \nThe IRCS, in coordination with local authorities, conducted field assessments in the affected districts and branches in \nthe affected provinces to identify the immediate needs and priorities. According to the preliminary assessments carried \nout in the areas, WASH, health, and livelihood packages are among the most pressing needs of the drought-affected \npeople. Under this DREF operation, the IRCS aims to ensure the effective continuation of the humanitarian operations, \nP a g e  | 4 \n \n \n \nRestricted \nspecifically for WASH, health, and livelihoods for the most vulnerable people. Unconditional cash grants will give \ndignified choice to the targeted population under DREF. The same modality might evolve differently under appeal.  \n \nTargeting  \nThe four targeted provinces were identified as a priority due to the sensitivity of security at borders \n(Afghanistan/Pakistan), IRCS is the only well-established stakeholder who has system, structure, acceptance, access \nto these. Hence, they have a water donation program (multiyear) as well, so for the water sector/crisis response, it is \nmainly IRCS who is also seen in these bordering areas as a major actor. \n \nSince IRCS is mandated as the lead convener for disaster response and rescue in the country, it is important to follow \na sensitive approach and clear criteria in the selection of HHs. Almost 712,500 families in all four provinces are in dire \nneed of basic assistance, yet no single humanitarian organization can serve on such a large scale. As a result, IRCS \nplans to support 20,800 HHs (extremely vulnerable). A set of criteria and a strong communication strategy will be chalked \nout to answer the justification for stakeholders about whom to select. IRCS is engaged in \u2018\u2019water donation\u2019\u2019 multiyear \nrecovery rehabilitation program, has systems and structures in place to gain stakeholders\u2019 endorsement and validation.  \n \nThe number of resources allocated to each geographic area will be determined by the population density of the provinces \nand the severity of the drought. The targeting criteria includes: Villagers\u2019 family information, deprived families (widows, \nwomen-headed households, physically disabled people, people with special needs, single parents, minors) are among \nthe targeting criteria, which are collected and validated by the Imam Khomani Relief Committee and Welfare \nOrganization and Ministry of Education. \n \nScenario planning \nTo alleviate the suffering of drought-affected people, a massive water delivery project was launched by IRCS in the \ntargeted provinces over the previous three years, where we witnessed the tolerance (not resilience) of these people in \nunusual drought conditions. Due to the size of the country and the existence of water-rich areas, wealthier people in the \nregion have migrated as the drought has progressed, leaving the remaining people without the resources to migrate, \nmaking them the most deserving of humanitarian aid. \nInnovations and three years of experience by the IRCS in conducting drinking water supply programs (offering relief \nitems and water for rural communities) to alleviate human suffering caused by deprivation, drought, and water \nfluctuations. \nOn the other hand, IRCS is working on a disaster risk reduction program focusing on the development of rural \u201cHelal \nHouses\u201d, humanitarian hotspots on the bridges of poverty alleviation programs, as well as the ability to plan these \nhouses upstream and local demand downstream, with the possibility of using appropriate and local tools to reduce the \nhuman suffering caused by drought. The combination of the \"Drinking Water Supply Project\" and the \" Helal Houses\" \nunder national and international support can bring better results in service and drought tolerance by the deprived \ncommunities. \n \nScenario \n \nHumanitarian consequence \n \nPotential Response \n \nIncrease in COVID-19 \ncommunity \ntransmission \nPossible \ndisplacement \nmight \ntrigger the infection spread. \nIRCS \nto \ncontinue \nrisk \nawareness \neducation \naction, \nfollowing \nsafety \nprotocols, scaling up response including \nvaccination advocacy and promotion with \npreparedness actions to limit spread. \nSanctions  \n \nOperational \npace \nreduced, \ninternational procurement and funds \ntransfers will be impacted and hence \nreplenishment \nand \nfinancial \nresources will be delayed reaching \nIRCS.  \nIFRC striving for OFAC clearance for \nspecific banking channel (funds transfer) \nor finding makeshift solutions to support \noperational costs/funds channelling.

Operational strategy \n \nOverall Operational objective: \nContinuity of \n the Iranian Red Crescent Society\u2019s \n field activities in response to the drought crisis for the next months, that \nserves the following sectorial interventions: \n1. WASH: Water supply and sanitation, including the renovation of flumes and wells, the improvement of the \nstate of water tanks, the purification of water, and the repair of water tanks. \n2. Health: Improving the level of health including public health, mental health, and PSS (MHPSS). Deployment \nof volunteer physicians as heath units to visit patients in need.  \n \n \n \n \n3. Livelihood and Basic Needs: Cash and Voucher Assistance (CVA), social damage reduction, and basic needs \nfulfilment.  \n \nThe overall objective of this DREF operation is to protect and save lives, dignity and to mitigate adverse effects on the \ndeteriorating livelihoods, trying to organize safe drinking water access and personal hygiene.  \n \nMost notably, over the coming five months, to support the provision of basic health care and MHPSS to communities \naffected by the ongoing drought. \n \nThe Iranian Red Crescent Society seeks to act in the direction of sustainable development and offer sustainable facilities \nin regions plagued by water shortages, in addition to providing support services. \n \nDuring the initial phase of the project, a working group comprised of local provincial officials from several disciplines \nidentifies needs, methods of action, and duties of each person and system in accordance with the project's timetable. \nThey are in charge of purchasing, distributing, and providing needed items. All responsible and local agencies will \nsupport the activities based on previous similar efforts. Local authorities consist of villagers and local councils. \n \nHuman resources  \nThe International Operation Division of the IRCS will serve as the liaison between international support and operational \nresponse. All trained/field professionals working for the IRCS Volunteer Organization will be on the front lines. This \noperation does not require significant HR recruitment because the IRCS has a large pool of experienced HR personnel \nto deploy to the field. COVID- 19 SOPs will be strictly followed by all HR personnel. The communication unit will support \npromotional/reporting and Farsi to English translations for operations updates. IRCS is in the phase of several years of \nthe \u2018\u2019water donation\u2019\u2019 project, the existing staff and trained volunteers under the volunteers' organization will be \nperforming DREF operation and in parallel, the recovery aspects will be under the same file.  \nP a g e  | 7 \n \n \n \nRestricted \nThe IFRC MENA Regional Office and the Iran Country Delegation will provide additional technical support services, \ncoordination, and technical assistance with an available pool of HR experts (if needed by IRCS).  \n \nLogistics and procurement  \nIRCS will try to make most of the procurements locally, aligned with the IFRC procurement regulations and standards \n(with support of Global Humanitarian Services and Supply Chain (GHS & SCM) MENA team). The rationale being the \nsanctions limitations in terms of international procurements. Unless some specific items are needed from abroad, IFRC \nwill support via the MENA procurement supply chain unit. Most of the required items are available and IRCS is well \nexperienced with a strong compliance accountability procurement system. For all procurement with a total value \nequivalent or more than CHF 50,000, and or any procurement involving drugs, medical supplies, and PPE, the complete \nfile will be validated by IFRC (GHS & SCM) before placing the order or signing the contract. IRCS fleet is one of the \nbiggest in the region. As this operation requires operational costs to be covered for staff, warehouses, vehicles, etc. in \naddition, further ensuring quality of supply DREF budget will be used for coverage of warehousing services provided by \nIRCS. The DREF will cover the costs of fuel and vehicle rental required for transport of aid assistance and personnel to \nand from the operational area. For long-term response, water tanks are needed but that will be catered under a long-\nterm emergency plan of action, not DREF. For cash grants, an already existing banking and social protection system \nwill be utilized. IRCS is well experienced in this domain after being a seasoned stakeholder in this field (previous crisis \nresponses experiences).  \n \nCommunity Engagement and Accountability (CEA)  \nCEA will be streamlined throughout the implementation of the project. Branch officers and volunteers will ensure timely \nfeedback and response is provided and the response is effective. The project will be concerned with people\u2019s safety, \ndignity, and rights, and avoid exposing people to further harm by ensuring selection of people in need, project activities, \nand objectives are transparent. Affected persons will receive support based on the need to ensure people receive \nappropriate assistance and are protected. This will ensure active and meaningful participation of the affected \ncommunities from the very beginning of the response to the transition phase into a longer-term programme.  \nA feedback and complaints desk will be set up to collect any complaints or feedback which may come up. In addition, \nIFRC will ensure monitoring of this activity through its CVA Regional Coordinator. Feedback on this specific aspect \nduring the first distribution will inform any eventual change of strategy to ensure that the people in need receive the cash \ndisbursements. IRCS EOC centres, a hotline for the response, Helal Houses rooted into deep communities are also \ntwo-way communication channels. IRCS news/social media (in Farsi) is also one of the strongest tools which are \nfunctioning very well in the operational context of the country.  \n \nPlanning, monitoring, evaluation and reporting (PMER) \nThe IRCS with the support of the IFRC country delegation and regional office will lead on reporting, monitoring, and \nevaluation of this operation. Reporting on the operation will be carried out in accordance with the IFRC DREF reporting \nstandards. Regular updates will be issued during the operation\u2019s timeframe with a final report issued within three months \nafter the end of the operation.   \n \nTechnical PMER capacity and technical support will be provided through IFRC MENA Regional office PMER team. This \nwill help identify and, where possible and necessary, resolve any issues. An end-of-operation lessons learned exercise \nwill take place to capture the relevance, efficiency, and effectiveness of the operation. It will also be used to measure \nqualitative outcome indicators and to ensure that the best practices are captured to inform the planning and designing \nof the long-term projects towards improved ways of working and increasing effectiveness and efficiency to the \ncommunities.  \n \nSecurity  \nThe IRCS has good access and acceptance throughout the country due to its strong historical performance in line with \nits mandate. All four affected provinces are for the most part categorized by the government as a Red Zone (For \nCOVID-19 reasons) in addition to Sistan Balochistan and South Khorasan which are bordering Afghanistan and \nPakistan. In these regions, and throughout Iran, IFRC colleagues are obliged to comply with the IFRC Minimum \nSecurity Requirements which outline a strong security framework within which the IFRC operates in both regular and \nemergency operations. IRCS will facilitate field monitoring operational visits which will assist with and ensure access. \nIRCS will seek all security clearances for delegates to have access to the operational sites. IRCS colleagues will \naccompany IFRC delegates during any field visits. The Country delegation will closely monitor the security environment \nwith support from the Regional Security Coordinator. All Red Cross Red Crescent personnel actively involved in the \noperations must have completed the respective IFRC security e-learning courses (i.e. Stay Safe Personal Security, \nSecurity Management, and/or Volunteer Security). Road travel also presents a risk, and mitigation measures are in \nplace to reduce the likelihood and impact of these risks. Contingency plans are in place to manage any critical incident \nthat may occur during this operation. For the most part, access to these areas will be via air (except South Khorasan).  \n \nP a g e  | 8 \n \n \n \nRestricted \nExit Strategy  \nThe IRCS water donation project is in its fourth year in the same areas. This rehabilitation project is renewed annually \nand some local institutional donors contribute on a regular basis. The severe dry season and lack of rains have put \nenormous strain on local resources; additionally, the severity of the drought is impacting lack of water access, mental \nhealth and access to health service and access to food for humans and livestock, has compelled to respond via DREF \nunder the meeting basic needs criteria. \n \nDroughts cannot be addressed locally without international assistance (available resources depleting). Sanctions have \na significant impact on access to resources (financial/technical/material). As a result, one exit strategy is to combine the \nDREF operation with a parallel ongoing water donation initiative. However, for the long-term continuation of humanitarian \naction, IRCS/IFRC will continue the response to the droughts under a planned emergency appeal for 18-24 months to \ncater the needs and build some recovery strengthening networks for the affected communities. Also, under the current \nsituation, exiting the drought operation after five months will not be sufficient to meet the context's needs. \nP a g e  | 9 \n \n \n \n \nRestricted \nC.

Roughly, 16.5 CHF / family will be disbursed via the banking system. The IRCS \nFinance Department will calculate the exact amount based on the Iranian Rials exchange rate while transferring the fund to the beneficiaries' account numbers. COVID-19 \nimpacted livelihoods. The capital Tehran and 232 other cities and towns have been classified as high-risk \"red\" zones in terms of COVID fresh wave spread. All four targeted \nprovinces are coded RED as well, but IRCS has field structure and set up functional. Lockdowns are not impacting IRCS's humanitarian action. The support will cover existing \nbasic and diverse needs at the household level, have a positive effect on the local economy and contribute to the support of local market dynamics. IRCS is experienced to \nmanage CVA. Under current agreements and protocols between the IRCS and the banking industry, existing banking channel systems will be used. \n \nAny kind of cash assistance depends on a functioning market. As per a rapid check, IRCS did with local authorities in Kerman, Hormozgan, and South Khorasan provinces, \nmarkets are functioning with households accessing markets. All key food commodities are readily available in the market and the indication is that supply is constant and stable.  \n \nRisk analysis: Malnutrition and health problems will worsen if families do not receive cash assistance for food. At this time, the IFRC is unable to channel funds to Iran. At \nthe highest level, efforts are being made to develop a banking channel (sanctions impacted). \n \nPopulation to be assisted: 3,300 households (13,200 individuals) will receive unconditional five-month grants to meet basic needs. The recipients will be selected based on \nthe following criteria:  \n \n- \nDisplaced people by drought,  \n- \nPeople with severe disabilities, \n- \nWomen-headed households, widows, divorcees, separated, single parents with no income,   \n- \nHouseholds with insufficient coping mechanisms, \n- \nHouseholds form vulnerable occupational groups,  \n- \nHouseholds with socially excluded/marginalized members, \n- \nUnaccompanied children. \n \nProgramme standards/benchmarks: The activities will seek to meet Sphere standards. \n \nP a g e  | 10 \n \n \n \n \nRestricted \nP&B \nOutput \nCode \nLivelihoods and basic needs Outcome 1: Communities, especially in disaster and crisis \naffected areas, restore and strengthen their livelihoods \n# of households provided with unconditional /multipurpose \ncash grants and able to cover their monthly basic needs \n(Target: 3,300 HHs)  \nLivelihoods and basic needs Output 1.5: Households are provided with \nunconditional/multipurpose cash grants to address their basic needs \nActivities planned  \nWeek  \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \nAP081  \nRapid Assessment and market assessment \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAP081  \nUnconditional/multipurpose cash distributions for \n3,300 HHs in target provinces via bank transfer  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \nAP081  \nPost Distribution Monitoring after distribution  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHealth \nPeople targeted: 40,000 Individuals (10,000 households) \nMale: 19,000 \nFemale: 21,000 \nRequirements (CHF): 109,599 CHF \n \nNeeds analysis: Remoteness of targeted areas and vulnerability of communities have shown in assessments that basic health needs are to be looked into, by providing medical \ncare basic health teams, nurseries, elderlies, disabled and mother and neonatal child health, lactating mothers support, and PSS aspects. \nWater scarcity will dent the health aspects and skin issues, chronic diseases enhancement, dehydration, loss of livelihood triggered depression and cardiac issues. All of these \nfactors must be taken into consideration. \n \nRisk analysis: Due to the fact that the targeted areas are classified as high-risk \"red\" zones on Iran's coronavirus risk scale, extremely strict SOPs will be followed. The \ninflux of Afghan refugees/migrants has the potential to bring COVID-19 variants, hence strong coordination and management elements with public authorities and relevant \nstakeholders are required.  \n \nPopulation to be assisted: Based on the IRCS field assessments by provincial branches, the planned activities, and deployment of the mobile clinics to meet the health \nneeds of the affected population will principally target the women and children and ultimately the larger community.

IRCS will provide according to the context of the topography and \nneeds, two ways of access to safe drinking water: basic water needs (15L/Ind/Day-sphere) and will consume efforts to keep water provision pure by utilizing purification efforts \nin parallel. On top of these two approaches, the hygiene promotion awareness will be on daily basis to 54,000 Individuals in total. Hygiene parcels will be provided to 7,500 \nHHs as well. IRCS Water donation project\u2019s recovery/rehabilitation action will ensure to get communities maximum access to water. Hygiene kits will be distributed to \ncomplement not only water donation inputs but also DREF inputs will support as reciprocal action. A total of 30,000 people has access to water through two different methods. \nIRCS has connected the water supply to 3,000 litres 75 water tanks. Second, existing underground wells and aqueducts can be renovated or repaired.  \nFurthermore, the filtration component will ensure that the water is safe to drink for these 30,000 people for the next five months. \nEvery day, 300 people will benefit from hygiene awareness training (54,000 people). The hygiene parcels will be delivered to 7,500 families as well, based on a need-based \nselection process. The IRCS will serve as the lead coordinator for water supply, purification, transportation, repairs, and continuity in all topographic areas. IRCS will connect \nits multi-year water donation project with these areas. \n \nThe IRCS already has a multi-year water donation project in place and there is a need for training water committees in the management of water supplies and operation and \nmaintenance of infrastructure. this DREF action will only seek to ensure that 7,500 HHs have access to safe drinking and drinkable water. The approaches have been used \nand adopted by IRCS and communities in the targeted provinces for the past four years. \nP a g e  | 12 \n \n \n \n \nRestricted \nThe distance to water access for settlements is based on 500 meters. By renovating the aqueducts, certain locations will be able to provide available groundwater access. \nThis will also support 7,500 HHs by small interventions. \nThe third most important aspect is to keep the water clean and pure, for this purpose some small procurements will be done to keep water safe for utilization \nof people and livestock.  \n \nRisk analysis:  \nWater shortages in reservoirs, wells, and canals are major issues in these areas. Additionally, the cost of purchasing and transporting water to residences will be exceedingly \nhigh. Water is life, and all four provinces have the most limited access to it. The supply of safe drinking water is being hampered by current droughts. It has a direct impact \non people's and livestock's health and livelihoods. Communities have no place to move as they lack resources, hence the operation is focused to meet the needs at the HH \nlevel. Hygiene and sanitation are difficult to access. If people are not having access to water, they will have serious health effects, dehydration, mental health deterioration, \nagriculture, and livestock is also at stake. Wrong social practices and dilemmas can creep in and protection issues will be higher in the areas. Since the areas of intervention \nare bordering areas with Afghanistan and Pakistan, hence security and access are mostly only granted to IRCS due to their credibility and history of engagement with \ncommunities. Hence few actors are present but according to the auxiliary role assigned to IRCS, they have to work very closely with the IRCS system and structures. \nAdditionally, the influx of Afghan migrants through Kerman, Sistan, and Balochistan, and South Khorasan will place extra strain on natural resources. As a result, not only is \nthe population vulnerable to drought, but also the red zone of COVID-19 and the possibility of an influx of Afghan migrants, making humanitarian assistance more in demand. \nAt this time, the IFRC is unable to channel funds to Iran. At the highest level, efforts are being made to develop a banking channel (sanctions impacted). \n \nPopulation to be assisted: Reduce the drought's impact on 7,500 households by providing water storage, purification, and quality control, as well as access to clean drinking \nwater, awareness, and hygiene sanitation kits. \nPrioritization will be given to communities with the most severe water shortages but who may have access to water. \n \nProgramme standards/benchmarks: The activities will seek to meet Sphere standards. \n \nWASH Outcome1: Immediate reduction in risk of waterborne and water related diseases in \ntargeted communities \n# of WASH assessments conducted in the targeted areas (target:3) \nWASH Output 1.1:  Continuous assessment of water, sanitation, and hygiene situation is carried \nout in targeted communities \n# of monitoring visits in the targeted areas (target: 3) \nActivities planned \nWeek   \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \nConduct an initial assessment of the water, sanitation, \nand hygiene situation in targeted communities \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nContinuously monitor the water, sanitation and \nhygiene situation in targeted communities \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWASH Output 1.2:  Daily access to safe water which meets Sphere and WHO standards in terms of \nquantity and quality is provided to target population \n% of target population with access to an improved water source \n(target: 100%) \nActivities planned \nWeek  \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \nP a g e  | 13 \n \n \n \n \nRestricted \nDetermine the appropriate method of household water \ntreatment for each community based on effectiveness \nand user preference. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDistribute water treatment products  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMonitor treatment and storage of water through \nhousehold surveys and household water quality tests \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWASH Output 1.5: Hygiene-related goods (NFIs) which meet Sphere standards and training on \nhow to use those goods is provided to the target population   \n# of households provided with a set of essential hygiene items \n(target: 7,500) \nActivities planned \nWeek  \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \nDevelop a hygiene communication plan.

This has delayed the deployment of 12 water purification units to supply water to 24,000 people as \nwell as public awareness and communications on disease prevention and hygiene promotion.  \n \nThe latest needs assessments conducted by VNRC in March 2020 have highlighted the need for the National Society \nto provide people affected by drought and salt intrusion with water supply and livelihoods support through cash grants. \nVNRC is thus considering the possibility to request a second DREF allocation to address these needs.  \n \nThe major donors and partners of the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) include the Red Cross Societies and \ngovernments of Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, German, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, New Zealand, \nNorway, Republic of Korea, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland, as well as DG ECHO and Blizzard Entertainment, \nMondelez International Foundation, and Fortive Corporation and other corporate and private donors. The IFRC would \nlike to extend thanks to all for their generous contribution. \n \nA. Situation analysis \n \nDescription of the disaster  \n \nThe Mekong Delta has a total population of 19 million people, \naccounting for 21 per cent of the national population. The Mekong \nDelta is the largest center of agricultural, fishery and fruit \nproduction in Viet Nam. The region's rice production accounts for \n50 per cent of the country. The region produces more than 90 per \ncent of the country's rice export and more than 60 per cent of the \ncountry's seafood production. Fruit trees play an important role in \nthe region and in Viet Nam in general. The GDP of the Mekong \nDelta as of June 2019 is 7.8 per cent. \n \nOperation Update Report  \nViet Nam: Drought and saltwater intrusion \n \nMr. Anh Tuan, member of the National Disaster Response \nTeam assessed the drought-stricken rice area at Hoa Thuan \nward, Chau Thanh district, Tra Vinh province. (Photo: VNRC) \nP a g e  | 2 \n \n \nThe rainy season in 2019 in the Mekong was late in comparison to recent years and its duration was also short. \nTherefore, the total annual flow of Mekong river was lower than its annual average. The river flow to Viet Nam has \nrapidly decreased from the beginning of the last dry season and is now at a very low level compared to the annual \naverage flow level of many years recorded from 1980 to the present. Two key upstream factors that dominate water \nresources and saline intrusion in the dry season of 2019/2020 in the Mekong Delta are reserves in the Tonle Sap and \nthe flow to Kratie (Mekong Delta). The flow of the Mekong Delta is seriously low, even lower than 2015 to 2016 (the \nyear when the record drought and saline intrusion occurred). This is the main cause of the early, deep and prolonged \ndrought and saline intrusion occurring, which affects people and production in the Mekong Delta. \n \nAccording to data from the Central Steering Committee on Disaster Prevention and Control, ten out of 13 provinces \nincluding 74 out of 137 districts are affected by the drought and saline intrusion. More than 685,000 people in the \nMekong Delta provinces were affected. Drought and saline intrusion have affected agricultural production, with \nestimated production losses of about 460,000ha and approximately 200,000 households lacking safe water for \ndomestic uses. The conditions have resulted in a water shortage and significant damage to crops, threatening \nagricultural production, livelihoods, and access to safe water by local people. The situation has a high adverse impact, \nas these provinces are the country\u2019s main rice growing regions.  \n \nGiven the early onset of saline intrusion which is expected to \nintrude further inland and last for a longer time, agriculture \nproduction in some areas can be affected such as the winter \nto spring rice crop of 2019/2020, which is greatly affected by \nthe irrigation water shortage, especially in coastal areas from \nJanuary 2020 onwards. Summer to autumn rice crop of 2020 \nwill also be seriously affected by saline intrusion if early rains \ndoes not come. As a result, (i) production costs increase due \nto the use of connection pumps (two to three levels) to take \nadvantage of low water levels in on-farm canals to control the \ndrought; (ii) in some areas where freshwater supply is \nunavailable, aquaculture production can be reduced or \ndamaged due to high salinity levels (e.g. An Minh, An Bien in \nKien Giang province, South National Highway 1A in Bac Lieu \nprovince, Thanh Phu, and Ba Tri in Ben Tre province); (iii) \nthere is a possibility of freshwater shortage supply for people \nliving in coastal areas, especially in estuary areas (e.g. Tan \nPhu Dong in Tien Giang province, Hoa Minh in Tra Vinh province, Cu Lao Dung in Soc Trang province, and coastal \ndistricts in Ben Tre province). \n \nProvince \nPossible impact on \nwinter-spring rice \n(hectares) \nEst. total population affected \nby drought and saline \nintrusion (people) \nEst. impact on people (persons) \nWomen \nChildren \nLong An \n1,000 \n52,700 \n27,931 \n12,712 \nTien Giang \n28,112 \n86,732 \n39,029 \n17,563 \nBen Tre \n2,000 \n205,000 \n99,520 \n20,953 \nTra Vinh \n68,500 \n63,818 \n32,292 \n16,018 \nSoc Trang \n49,759 \n86,488 \n40,956 \n19,674 \nBac Lieu \n5,400 \n56,820 \n29,615 \n13,707 \nKien Giang \nNA \n80,000 \n34,831 \n16,298 \nCa Mau \nNA \n54,000 \n27,300 \n13,432 \nTotal \n \n685,558 \n331,474 \n130,357 \nTable 1: Table of potential impact on population and livelihoods. (Source: VNDMA) \n \nAccording to the initial findings from the joint assessment conducted on 14 and 15 January 2020 led by UNICEF and \nUNDP where VNRC PDRT also participated, the salt intrusion has started to cause negative impacts on the local \npopulation as the photo taken in Tra Vinh province above. There has been signs of freshwater shortages for domestic \nand production usages. With the coming dry season, this problem might be more significant within the region, \nespecially with the poor households, who are suffering not only from water shortage but also from decrease of income \nas there has been decreasing needs for labour as a result of production interruption. The assessment also revealed \nthat there might be risks of hygiene issues and water related diseases (especially with the poor, women and girls) as \nrainfall is expected to be low in the coming months. There might be a high risk of food insecurity and loss of income \nespecially among poor and vulnerable households as the region is the country\u2019s main producers of rice. Map of the \naffected provinces can be accessed here. \nFigure 1: Saline map of Mekong delta. (Source: VNDMA) \nP a g e  | 3 \n \n \nAccording to experts1 , the Mekong Delta region is facing abnormal weather attributed to climate change, tide changes \nin amplitude, propagation and discharge, subsidence resulting from over-extraction of groundwater, and upstream \nwater retention. As of 17 March, Mekong River tidal stations of Tan Chau and Chau Doc reported water levels \nfluctuating in line with their long-term averages due to the tidal effect from the sea (Mekong River Commission).  \n \nThe ongoing drought, water shortage and saltwater intrusion are exposing a higher number of vulnerable people in the \nMekong Delta region to significant water shortage risks. A total of 13 out of the 63 provinces of Viet Nam have been \naffected and five provinces (Kien Giang, Tien Giang, Ben Tre, Long An, Ca Mau) have declared a state of emergency \n(level 2). Considering seasonal forecasts, the government and partners are implementing actions to address needs \nand assist affected households. National and international actors are supporting households with improved water \nstorage systems and with communication campaigns on water, sanitation and hygiene promotion (WASH), food \nsecurity, agriculture, health and nutrition, education, gender and protection. The government has identified several \nmeasures that need to be implemented on the ground and which highlight some of the existing response gaps to be \naddressed. \n \nOn 3 March 2020, the UN reaffirmed its commitment to working closely with the government, VNRC, INGOs, and \nbilateral institutions to best respond to unmet needs of affected people, as well as supporting the government to \nrecover, rehabilitate and build back better. As of 7 March, five provinces have declared a state of emergency. On 8 \nMarch, the Prime Minister while visiting affected areas, agreed to declare natural disaster in five provinces and \nannounced VND 350 billion (CHF 15 million) to support relief efforts. The COVID-19 outbreak is putting an additional \nsocio-economic pressure on vulnerable households already affected by drought and saltwater intrusion.  \n \nSummary of the current response \n \nOverview of Host National Society  \nClose coordination between VNRC and its government \ncounterparts is assured through the National Society\u2019s \npresence in the National Steering Committee on Natural \nDisaster Prevention and Control. VNRC participated in the \nUN led coordination meeting which took place in Hanoi on \n13 January 2020 where it was attended by UN agencies, \nINGOs, and governmental agencies. In the meantime, \nVNRC also shared some updates on actions taken by the \nlocal chapters, such as a needs assessment conducted by \nits Provincial Disaster Response Team (PDRT) in eight \nprovinces. In addition, VNRC has deployed its PDRT \nmembers to join the joint assessment which was led by \nUNDP in Ben Tre and Ca Mau from 15 to 16 January \n2020.  \n \nVNRC has been closely monitoring the drought and saline \nintrusion with local counterparts. At the local level, the \nNational Society has been coordinating with local \nauthorities and partners including private sector to provide \nhousehold well-digging assistance (a group of two to three \nhouseholds per well) and this is also part of VNRC \ncampaign on \u201cMonth of Humanitarian Actions\u201d.  \n \nUnder this reporting period, VNRC has conducted the \nfollowing interventions in 12 targeted communes in Ben \nTre, Bac Lieu and Tra Vinh provinces: \n \n\u2022 \nDistributed 12,000 jerry cans to 6,000 households (23,106 people including 10,279 females) \n\u2022 \nDeployed 12 units of brackish-water filtration machines for river water with salinity of below 8g/l \n \nIn total, 310,600 litres of safe/drinking water were provided to people in need from 12 selected communes in Ben Tre, \nBac Lieu and Tra Vinh provinces. 6,644 households in 12 communes collected safe water from 12 units of brackish-\nwater filtration machines between 8 March and 2 April 2020.  \n \n1 Viet Nam Disaster Management Authority, Southern Institute of Water Resources Research, Raise and Fall Project \u2013 Utrecht University and Can \nTho University \n \nMany households have to buy fresh water by small delivery tanker \ntrucks. (Photo: VNRC) \nP a g e  | 4 \n \n \nIn addition, detailed needs assessments have been conducted in three provinces from 11 to 20 March to inform VNRC \nof the needs and possible interventions. The assessments were conducted by VNRC NDRT members and PDRTs in \nthese three provinces. The assessment suggested that many households in these three provinces are in desperate \nneed of water for daily consumption (i.e. at least 57,000 households in Ben Tre, 80,000 households in Tra Vinh and \n68,000 households in Bac Lieu) as well as fresh water for cultivating their fruit crops (durian, mangosteen, coconut). \nImpact on livelihoods are obviously reported due to saline intrusion leading to no water to cultivate their crops and \nmany households reported that the drought this year seems to be the hardest hit in the past many decades, especially \nto those households with no alternative livelihood options but single source such as fruit crop. According to this \nassessment, rainy season shall come only in June or July which people hope can ease the tension of the situation. It \nis noted that many households have to buy fresh water by small delivery tanker truck as the photo above with high \nprice due to the transportation cost and distance. \n \nVNRC with support from Mitsubishi Motors\u2019s local subsidiary, provided 102 water tanks of 1,500 litres capacity to 102 \nhouseholds (387 people including 182 women) in Ben Tre, Tien Giang and Soc Trang provinces (not covered by this \nDREF allocation). \n \nOverview of Red Cross Red Crescent Movement in country \nThe IFRC Community Safety and Resilience \n(CSR) Manager from Country Cluster Support \nTeam (CCST) Bangkok has convened a meeting \nwith VNRC technical departments and Partner \nNational Societies (PNSs) (American Red Cross \nand Swiss Red Cross) in Hanoi on 15 January \n2020 to discuss about the potential interventions \nafter the call for support from the government of \nViet Nam. In the meantime, the CSR Manager \nhas been coordinating and working closely with \nVNRC, providing support to the National Society \nfor updating the information and monitoring the \nsituation.  \n \nOverview of non-RCRC actors in country \nSince September 2019, the Prime Minister of \nViet Nam has chaired the conference to discuss \non the situation and finding-out the solutions to \ncope with the drought and saline intrusion in the Mekong Delta. In that connection, in October 2019, the Ministry of \nAgriculture and Rural development (MARD) held a regional conference to change production for the drought and \nsaline intrusion season 2019/2020. It was requested that all localities have specific plans to respond. \n \nThe National Center for Hydrometeorological Forecasting has been regularly providing forecasts and warnings on the \nsituation. VNRC is a member of the UN Humanitarian Country Team and on the Disaster Management Working Group \nas well as convening the inter-agency Shelter Cluster and Cash Working Group. VNRC has been informally sharing \ninformation with these groups as requested. In addition to that, VNRC has close relationships with members of the \nlocal corporate sector, who will help in providing some in-kind assistance including fresh water bottles and food items. \n \nIn December 2019, the Deputy Chairman of Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control \n(CCNDPC) and the Minister of MARD appealed UN agencies, members of the National Partnership for Disaster Risk \nReduction, NGOs and all to extend the support to the Mekong Delta provinces in the face of drought and saline \nintrusion. UN agencies, VNRC and INGOs are supporting and coordinating with the government and VNDMA to \nmonitor impact and respond to identified gaps, including the following activities:  \n \n\u2022 \nUNDP (USD 185,000 equivalent to CHF 182,000) is supporting the government with field assessments, \ninformation sharing, coordination and planning events, recovery and long-term resilience building planning, \nand livelihood support. \n\u2022 \nUNICEF (USD 200,000 equivalent to CHF 198,000) is supporting WASH activities (providing 1000l water \ntanks, soap, hand sanitizers and water filters) and communication campaigns on WASH, health and nutrition, \neducation, and child protection in Ben Tre and Soc Trang. \n\u2022 \nUN WOMEN and FAO (VND 600 million equivalent to CHF 25,500) are supporting community awareness \nraising and technical assistance in Ca Mau. \n\u2022 \nSave the Children (USD 110,000 equivalent to CHF 108,900) is supporting with household water storage \nutilities and WASH in schools and communities in Ca Mau. \n\u2022 \nEast Meets West (USD 40,000 equivalent to CHF 39,600) is supporting affected communities with WASH \nactivities in Ben Tre. \nSelected households received jerry cans to collect safe water from water \nfiltration machines in Bac Lieu province. (Photo: Bac Lieu branch) \nP a g e  | 5 \n \n \nNeeds analysis, targeting, scenario planning and risk assessment \n \nNeeds analysis  \nThe 2019 rainy season in the Mekong basin appeared much later \nthan in average years, resulting in drought conditions and historic \nlow levels of flow, raising concerns for elevated drought and \nsaltwater intrusion for the entire Mekong Delta in the 2019/2020 \ndry season. Saltwater intrusion has appeared earlier in the year \nthan the historic 2015/2016 low levels of flow. To date, saltwater \nintrusion of 4g/l has entered up to 110km inland (Vam Co Dong, \nVam Co Tay), more than 30km beyond the highest long-term \naverage levels (VDMA, Meteorological Department, MARD). \n \nVNRC team analyzed local needs reported in three provinces and \nconvenes with local authorities and ongoing response actions by \nother stakeholders to propose that VNRC will continue to support \nless than 10 per cent of total numbers of people in need but focus \nto assist only the selected poor and near poor households in six \ncommunes of Ben Tre province, six communes of Tra Vinh \nprovince, four communes of Bac Lieu province, two communes of \nCa Mau province and two communes of Kien Giang province. It is \nnoted that the two provinces of Ca Mau and Kien Giang were not \ntargeted under this DREF operation but with the support of \nAmerican Red Cross and Swiss Red Cross, VNRC has also \nmanaged to conduct a needs assessment in these two provinces \nand it is suggested that these provinces should be added in \nVNRC\u2019s plan of action for a potential additional DREF allocation since they are both severely affected. VNRC and its \nchapter will inform and coordinate with government of Viet Nam and other actors to avoid overlaps and maximize \nresponse operation in these provinces. \n \nProvince \nNumber of \naffected HHs \nin selected \ncommunes \nNumber of \naffected \npoor HHs \nNumber of \naffected near-\npoor HHs \nNumber of \nHHs need \nsafe water \nNumber of HHs \nneed water tanks \nNumber of HHs \nneed early \nlivelihood recovery \nBen Tre \n17,844 \n1,495 \n1,116 \n8,235 \n821 \n674 \nTra Vinh  \n15,824 \n1,050 \n1,885 \n680 \n825 \n640 \nBac Lieu  \n11,867 \n195 \n729 \n285 \n265 \n455 \nCa Mau \n7,342 \n328 \n112 \n440 \n440 \n440 \nKien Giang \n7,074 \n272 \n965 \n462 \n462 \n0 \nTotal \n59,951 \n3,340 \n4,807 \n10,102 \n2,813 \n2,209 \nTable 2: Needs reported in selected communes of five provinces for VNRC response. (HH: household) \n \nBased on the assessments which were carried out in five provinces, of which three were supported under this DREF \noperation while two others were supported by the American Red Cross and Swiss Red Cross, water for daily use has \nbeen identified as the first priority follow by the support for the most affected people to access food, planting seeds, \nmedical services and livestock through unconditional cash grants.  \n \nBeneficiary selection  \nIn order to further define potential interventions vis-a-vis beneficiaries, it is suggested that VNRC would conduct early \nactions, early response and a deeper needs assessment to inform a detailed response operation plan with targeted \nlocations and interventions. The VNRC will ensure a thorough coordination with partners and local authorities on the \nground to avoid any potential duplication, and the use of Red Cross staff and volunteers will be optimized at all levels.  \n \nScenario planning  \nSalinity intrusion is associated with low water discharge from upstream of the Mekong River. With insufficient \nupstream water flow to push back seawater, salinity intrusion increased in concentration and duration this year. It was \nalso aggravated by the drought and high temperature in the region. The salinity level in the Mekong River system \nincreased, peaked two months earlier, intruded further inland and remained longer during the dry season.  With \nsaltwater intruding deeper and earlier than expected, people living in the Mekong Delta face a crippling freshwater \nshortage. The MARD warned that drought and saltwater intrusion would affect 13 provinces in the delta several \nmonths earlier in 2020. It said the seawater could intrude 45 to 110 kilometers inland this time, slightly deeper than in \n2016, and affect more than 460,000 hectares of land under winter to spring rice crop. Some 200,000 households \nwould face the risk of water shortage, expected to be the worst hit. \nPoor households have only one small water tank which \ncannot store enough fresh water. (Photo: VNRC) \nP a g e  | 6 \n \n \nWater for daily consumption is critical for many households. \n(Photo: VNRC Tra Vinh branch) \nOperation Risk Assessment  \nOver half a million of people is expected to be directly affected by the disaster in all 13 provinces of the Mekong Delta. \nTherefore, VNRC need to establish a well-coordinated approach with partners on the ground, including the local \nauthorities and civil society organizations (CSOs). In addition, VNRC headquarters will closely monitor and provide \ntechnical support to the provincial chapters and at the same time work closely with the local government in the \nbeneficiary selection process to ensure the process is accountable and transparent for the affected communities.  \n \n \nB. Operational strategy \n \nOverall Operational objective  \nThis DREF operation aims at deploying early response actions towards the potential affected population through \nneeds assessment and provision of safe water, and hygiene/health promotion interventions to 24,000 people in three \nworst affected provinces of Ben Tre, Bac Lieu and Tra Vinh in Mekong Delta within six months.  \n \nProposed strategy \n \nThe DREF operation targets three worst affected provinces in the Mekong Delta. The selection of the provinces was \nbased on needs, resources available and the support from the government of Viet Nam and humanitarian actors. This \naction augments and does not duplicate continuing assessment done by other donors and agencies. \n \nThe assistance provided to these affected provinces ensures the needs of the most vulnerable people are consulted, \nvalidated and met, including access to clean water for consumption, domestic use and support for hygiene promotion \nand communication leading to the reduction of health risks. The local authorities and Red Cross personnel have \nsufficient abilities in early response and help for the local population. \n \nCurrently, VNRC has 12 prepositioned brackish-water filtration machines, with the capacity of 500 litres per hour, in \nthe Mekong Delta region, which are now in Ben Tre province (three machines), Bac Lieu province (three machines) \nand Tra Vinh province (six machines). VNRC has a team of WASH specialists and a technician, who assists the \nVNRC branches as well as the communities with the operations and maintenance of the water treatment units. In this \nconnection, VNRC provides trainings to communities, so that they are able to manage some of the operations and \nmaintenance and not be fully dependent on external technical specialists. \n \nThe operation proposed interventions focus on:  \n \n\u2022 \nConducting an intensive needs assessment in three \nprovinces, on the areas of WASH, food security and \nlivelihoods to inform the next steps of interventions \nacross the sectors. \n\u2022 \nDeployment of pre-positioned water filtration units to \nprovide safe water to vulnerable people. The plan is \nto deploy the brackish-water machines to remote \nand hard-hit villages/communes which can help \ncommunity people to quickly meet needs for some \nperiod of time. \n\u2022 \nProvision and organization of training on WASH \ncommunication \nand \ndissemination \nof \nWASH \nknowledge and skills (e.g. know how to respond to \nthe current situation of drought and saline intrusion) \nin three provinces. \n\u2022 \nDistribution of safe drinking water to households which are heavily affected by the drought and saltwater \nintrusion. The operation shall provide two 20-litre jerry cans/bottles to each targeted household. The \nbeneficiaries will have fresh water for their daily use and consumption. VNRC recognizes that deliveries of 20-\nlitre bottled water are not a cost-efficient method of bringing fresh water to people. However, in some \ncommunities, there are few other more cost-effective methods. This method will be used where it is most \npractical as advised by WASH specialists. \n\u2022 \nImprovement of WASH services through hygiene and health promotion (including vector control and \nhandwashing) for households. WASH dissemination in the communities is conducted with the participation of \nlocal families. \n \nIn order to implement the project successfully and effectively, VNRC has issued several specific guidelines as follows: \nP a g e  | 7 \n \n \n\u2022 \nDeveloped a project implementation plan, which requires the provincial VNRC chapters to report to the \nprovincial People's Committees and relevant departments for attention, direction and support; establishing \nProject Management Board; develop work plans and budgets and direct VNRC units at districts and \ncommunes to receive and coordinate the assistance with the province. Technical departments of VNRC \nheadquarters (HQ) are also assigned to assist the Project Steering Committee and the provincial VNRC \nchapters to carry out the project activities. \n\u2022 \nSent official recommendations to the provincial People's Committees to direct and support the provincial \nchapters in implementing the project. \n\u2022 \nEstablished at the HQ and provinces: Project Management Board with experienced staff and relevant \ndepartments and units. \n\u2022 \nPrepared a budget plan, an operational plan and transfer funds to the Union provinces in accordance with the \nagreed operational plan. \n\u2022 \nDirected the VNRC Southern Representative office to participate in the project activities. \n \nThe needs and damage assessments of NDRT and PDRT teams in the provinces of Ben Tre, Bac Lieu and Tra \nVinh \nVNRC HQ cooperated with the provincial Red Cross chapters to develop work-plans and select communes for needs \nand damage assessments in 12 communes (including communes not selected for this response yet). Team members \nare from HQ, Southern Representative Office, Red Cross chapters of Nghe An and Ha Tinh provinces. Assessment \nsectors are WASH, livelihoods and other relevant sectors.

One finance officer was also assigned to the operation and responsible for overseeing the reconciliation of \nexpenditure and producing timely financial reports. At chapter level one focal point will be assigned in each province to \noversee the implementation of activities within the affected communes. A total of 50 volunteers will be mobilized for \nthis operation and provided with emergency health insurance as well as appropriate personal protective equipment. \n \nThe IFRC CCST has been providing support to VNRC in this operation through the technical review and inputs into \nthe assessment tools and planned to join the assessment, however due to the COVID-19 situation, the CCST \ncancelled the mission to Viet Nam. A Regional Disaster Response Team (RDRT) deployment is required to assist the \nVNRC with assessment and planning for the next phase of the DREF operation. \n \nCommunications \nThe VNRC communications team is ensuring that Red Cross response efforts are effectively communicated to the \npublic in a timely manner. VNRC staff and volunteers across the country are actively contributing to institutional \ncommunications through their own social media networks. VNRC staff conducting assessments in the field regularly \nP a g e  | 8 \n \n \nprovide information. The IFRC communications officer in Bangkok will support the VNRC in sharing voices from the \ncommunity and publicity through the production of audio-visual materials, including photos and/or videos. This will \nensure that the wider Red Cross Red Crescent membership and public have access to information on damage and \nneeds, and Red Cross Red Crescent response, in a timely and reliable manner. Efforts have been made to encourage \na more community and volunteer-centred approach to communication, where communities and volunteers are \nportrayed with dignity and as solution providers. Communication has been taking place on social media platforms, \nwebsites as well as engagement with local and international media. \n \nInformation technology and telecommunications \nThe DREF operation will cover costs of mobile phone credits and internet cards for the chapters involved. VNRC will \nensure that staff and volunteers involved in the operation are accessible via mobile phones. The chapters have \nsufficient computer software and hardware capacity, and support for the operational requirements.  \n \nSecurity \nThe IFRC security framework is applicable for this operation. With regards to VNRC staff and volunteers, the National \nSociety\u2019s security framework will apply. In terms of security during distributions, the National Society works very \nclosely with local government in the identification of appropriate distribution points, considering aspects such as \naccess and security. Local government will assist in deploying appropriate district and commune level staff to secure \ndistribution points and ensure that distributions run smoothly. \n \nCommunity engagement and accountability (CEA) \nVNRC has a proactive approach to community engagement and accountability. Affected communities will be engaged \nin the beneficiary selection process and will have access to information on the criteria being used for the selection \nprocess. Communities are also engaged in verifying information regarding beneficiary households to ensure that the \nmost vulnerable are reached. In addition, the National Society has a standard approach to establishing beneficiary \nfeedback mechanisms that will be activated during the selection and distribution processes at the commune level. \nPhone hotlines of VNRC Operation Manager and local chapter officer in charge of the operation will be established, \nand focal points not directly involved in the operation will be designated at both the headquarters and chapter levels, \nas well as within local authorities to receive beneficiary feedback. In addition, beneficiary feedback boxes will be made \navailable at beneficiary selection processes and distribution sites to allow anonymous feedback. Following the \ndistribution process, post-distribution monitoring (PDM) will be undertaken to assess the level of satisfaction from \nbeneficiaries regarding the nature of the response as well as different aspects of the distribution process, such as the \ntimeliness of the support and suitability of the distribution process. \n \nPlanning, monitoring, evaluation and reporting (PMER) \nReporting on the operation will be carried out in accordance with the IFRC reporting standards. Regular updates will \nbe issued during the operation\u2019s timeframe with a final report issued within three months after the end of the operation. \nThe operation will receive support through IFRC CCST PMER and Communications Officer. The operation monitoring \nteams will make field visits as needed. This will help identify, and where possible and necessary, resolve any issues. \nNecessary tools and templates for regular data collection and reporting will be adopted from existing PMER resources. \nIn addition, a PDM will be organized prior to a lessons learned workshop at the end of the operation to inform the \nVNRC and IFRC of the operation\u2019s successes and areas of improvement.  \n \nFinance and administration \nIFRC CCST Finance and Administration units will provide the necessary operational support for review, validation of \nbudgets, bank transfers, and technical assistance to VNRC on procedures for justification of expenditures, including \nthe review and validation of invoices. VNRC has implemented DREFs previously and has complied with the necessary \nfinancial procedures to the required standards. \n \nLogistics and supply chain \nLogistics activities aim to effectively manage the supply chain, including procurement, fleet, storage and transport to \ndistribution sites in accordance with the operation\u2019s requirements and aligned to IFRC\u2019s logistics standards, processes \nand procedures. \n \nVNRC shall consider requesting IFRC\u2019s support in terms of collapsible jerry cans if there is a need and stock in place. \nIn addition, VNRC is bound to follow the procurement laws of the government and have an established procurement \ncommittee structure which includes both the national and provincial level and appoints focal points to oversee the \nprocess and to ensure that the it meets requirements. Several VNRC staff have been trained in the government\u2019s \nprocurement regulations. IFRC Operational Logistics Procurement and Supply Chain Management (OLPSCM) will \nalso provide additional technical logistics/procurement support to IFRC CCST in Bangkok and VNRC as and when \nneeded.  \nP a g e  | 9 \n \n \nC.

The total number of participants who are staff from provinces \nand districts, and volunteers from 12 communes are 118 people (31 females).  \n \nThe content of training and practice include methods and skills of behaviour change communication, \ncommunication skills for group work, guidelines to prevent diseases, protection, gender and inclusion (PGI), and \ninstructions for using leaflets and posters for communication. \n \nAfter the training courses, 100 per cent of staff and volunteers can grasp basic knowledge about WASH and skills \nto conduct behaviour change communication lessons; develop outlines for communication lessons on topics of \nsanitation and water and infectious diseases; and develop communication events about clean water, sanitation \nand water-related infectious diseases. At the same time, Red Cross chapters also assigned communications staff \nin the selected communes for communication events.  \n \nA set of communication materials on diseases and WASH have been reproduced. Communication materials were \ndesigned and developed by the Healthcare Department and Communication and Volunteer Department in \nconsultation with Project Steering Committee. These documents are being printed and distributed by Red Cross \nchapters of selected provinces. A document set comprised of A4 sized leaflets on handwashing (1,500 copies), A2 \nsized posters (300 copies), 0.5m wide x 3m long horizontal banners (30 copies), 0.5m wide x 3m long vertical \nbanners (50 copies) and A4 sized epidemic PC leaflets (18,000 copies).

As \na result, these units were operated in three provinces: \n\u2022 \nBen Tre province from 7 March to 31 March 2020 producing 185,606 litres of water. \n\u2022 \nBac Lieu province from 18 March to 1 April 2020 producing 57,000 litres of water. \n\u2022 \nTra Vinh province from 18 March to 1 April 2020 producing 60,600 litres of water. \n \nTo date, 12 water purification units have provided 310,606 litres of safe water to 6,644 households in the 12 worst \naffected communes of these three provinces. The provincial Red Cross chapters also purchased additional \naccessories to ensure continuous operation of the deployed water filters such as plastic settling tanks, pumps, \nplastic pipes, filter cores, electrical appliances, etc. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAt least 6,000 households (23,106 people) in these communes also received two jerry cans per household to \nenable them to collect and store water for daily consumption. Each jerry can has the capacity of 20 litres and they \nwere procured locally following the IFRC procurement procedures.  \n \nBased on the knowledge and skills gained from the refresher trainings, Red Cross staff and volunteers conducted \nhygiene promotion sessions to 627 people (319 females) by organizing 24 hygiene promotion sessions from 23 \nMarch to 2 April 2020. Some sessions have been delayed due to COVID-19 restrictions: \n\u2022 \nBen Tre chapter completed 21 events in selected communes from 23 to 29 March. \n\u2022 \nBac Lieu chapter  only organized three events out of 21 planned events from 28 March to 2 April while 18 \nremained events are recommended to continue from late April to May. \n\u2022 \nNo event was organized in Tra Vinh province. It is also recommended to do 21 hygiene promotion \nsessions/events from late April to May. \n \nThe hygiene promotion events were held to engage the participation of local people through enthusiastic \ndiscussions and to gain knowledge about water, sanitation and prevention of infectious diseases. Red Cross \nvolunteers have good presentation skills, and can be mobilized for responses in future local emergency situations. \n \nWater distribution in Mo Cay Nam, Ben Tre province. \n(Photo: VNRC Tra Vinh branch) \nDistribution of jerry cans to the most affected people in Tra \nVinh province.

Argentine Red Cross (ARC) will continue to provide assistance \nbased on its ability to reach the affected population and following government-issued regulations; however, there \nwill be greater operational implementation challenges if restrictions continue. \n \nA. Situation analysis \n \nDescription of the disaster \n \nOn 20 January 2020, the government of province of Salta in \nArgentina declared a Social and Health Emergency for its north-\neastern regions due to the death of 8 children and the \nhospitalization of 30 others due to malnutrition, especially in \nindigenous communities in the departments of Rivadavia, San \nMart\u00edn and Or\u00e1n. Dozens of other children in areas under \nemergency were hospitalized, and some discharged, due to \ngastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses aggravated by their \nacute state of malnutrition and dehydration. Salta's Ministry of \nHealth has reported 855 cases of acute malnutrition in children \nunder five years of age and more than 10,000 at-risk cases in \nthe three departments under the emergency declaration. One of \nthe origins of this situation is the seasonal drought that began in \nthe last quarter of 2019 and intensified in February, which \ndirectly affected people's quality of life due to low food \nproduction, impact on livestock and, consequently, a significant \ndecrease in people's daily food consumption. \n \nArgentine Red Cross (ARC) began to provide assistance in the \nmost affected areas immediately after the declaration of \nemergency. The Argentine Red Cross Humanitarian Observatory conducted a field assessment that identified \n \nOperation Update \nArgentina: Drought \nThe Argentine Red Cross (ARC) established a \nfirst aid attention at the base camp in Mission \nGrande, Salta. Source: ARC \nPage | 2 \n \nthat 90 per cent of the population evaluated had a below normal nutritional status, registering 45 per cent for \nthe \u201cvery underweight\u201d indicator, using the Body Mass Index (BMI) scale. In addition, 84 per cent of the \nchildren assessed had experienced at least one episode of diarrhoea in the previous month linked to hygiene \nhabits and access to safe water. The National Society established a camp in the area to continue assisting \ncommunities and populations through health, water, hygiene and livelihood actions. \n \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has made access to health services more complex, as the significant distance \nbetween communities and health centres has been compounded by the closing of access roads and the \ndecrease in traffic. In addition to the reduced staff in health centres, prioritization is given to people with \nCOVID-19 symptoms and regular consult services remain suspended. As for the already limited water or \nelectricity supply services, all municipal staff are working reduced hours, which minimizes access and ability \nto solve problems. \n \n \nSummary of the current response \n \nOverview of Host National Society  \n \nArgentine Red Cross, with support from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent \nSocieties (IFRC), is responding to the emergency in the town of Santa Victoria Este, located 540 km from the \ncity of Salta. It was decided to set up a base camp in the Misi\u00f3n Grande area, approximately 15 km from \nSanta Victoria Este, from which it is able to provide response to more than 38 indigenous Wichis, Chorotes \nand Tobas communities. \n \nThe National Society established the first humanitarian camp in ARC's history, within which the National \nResponse Directorate activated an Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) to coordinate actions on the ground. \nThe camp has an operations centre, a first aid post, telecommunications, a logistics area, fleet, training rooms, \nkitchen, dining area, water supply and sanitation for communities. \n \nPrior to rolling out the operation, the field team met with more than 35 chieftains (caciques) and community \nleaders to socialize the planed operational actions that ARC would implement and to explain the Movement's \nmission and fundamental principles. These communities members\u2019 expressed a high level of acceptance and \ndemonstrated positive engagement in the pre-implementation processes.  \n \nThe National Society has provided support and care in the following aspects: \n \n\u2022 \nMore than 30 water assessments conducted at different collection points \n\u2022 \n4,000 individuals surveyed regarding household needs, using Open Data Kit (ODK)   \n\u2022 \n330 first aid services provided \n\u2022 \n556 household water filters distributed \n\u2022 \n740 jerrycans distributed \n \nSince the beginning of the operation, Argentine Red Cross, together with OCHA, IOM, UNHCR, UNICEF, the \nArgentine Army and ECHO, has been part of the coordination working group, convened by the Office of the \nUnited Nations Resident Coordinator that create a Global Action Plan that unites the actions of all these \norganizations. The working group maintains joint work and regular meetings (online in the COVID-19 context) \nwith the organizations, which are developing their specific action plans, and especially with the Argentine \nArmy on the ground to coordinate water distributions. \n \nOverview of Red Cross Red Crescent Movement in country \n \nPrior to the approval of this DREF operation, a surge Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion (WASH) \nspecialist was deployed to assist with assessment of communities' water sources and identify factors to \ncontribute to the WASH implementation strategy. \n \nThrough the IFRC Regional Logistic Unit (RLU), the National Society acquired bladders, jerrycans, household \nand community water filters, and hygiene kits (which are pending arrival). The latter were ultimately requested \nvia the RLU due to the significant increase in price in the country. The RLU also assisted with the shipping, \nquoting, purchasing and custom clearance processes. \nWithin the framework of the Plan of Action, Spanish Red Cross sent an a M15 Emergency Response Unit \n(ERU M15 with a Purification Line) to the country. It arrived in late April, has been set up and is in operation \nin the field. Simultaneously, 1600 jerrycans are being distributed to carry water from the plant or distribution \nPage | 3 \n \nbladders. Spanish Red Cross also donated 25,000 Euros to implement the operation and set up the base \ncamp. \n \n \n \nThe Spanish Red Cross donated a M15 Water Treatment Plant for this operation, as shown in the \npictures during its arrival in Ezeiza Airport Humanitarian Hub in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Source: \nArgentine Red Cross \n \nThe head of the IFRC Country Cluster Support Team (CCST) for the Southern Cone and Brazil has provided \ndirect and ongoing support to all planning and coordination processes by both the Red Cross and government \n(national and province) and external agencies. In addition, the IFRC Disaster Management coordinator and \nfinancial coordinator are providing support to the operation. \n \nOverview of non-RCRC actors in country \n \nSince 22 January 2020, the Argentine Army has been working in Santa Victoria Este, specifically in the \u201cEl \nRosado\u201d area, with a commission of water specialists from the V Mountain Brigade's engineering battalion, \nwhich has put into operation an M-11 water treatment plant with the capacity to produce 9000 litres per hour, \nproviding access to safe water in more than 15 communities in the area. \n \nSalta's Ministry of Public Health, with support from the National Ministry of Health, is assisting the Santa \nVictoria Este Hospital with reinforcements (medical/nursing personnel), basic ward equipment and a four-\nwheel drive ambulance to provide health care access to communities in the area. \n \nSalta's Ministry of Social Development was distributing monthly basic food kits to families affected by the \nemergency. Restrictions related to the pandemic interrupted this activity. \n \nThe Ministry of Public Health began an influenza vaccination campaign on 2 April, distributing 3,550 doses \nallocated to the Santa Victoria Este/Rivadavia area, which are being administered to targeted beneficiaries \nat their homes. On 3 April, the province government delivered six medium-complexity ambulances to \nstrengthen efforts in localities affected by the social and health emergency. \n \nOn 7 April, UNICEF delivered 1,000 nutritional supplements to the province to assist with the nutritional \nrecovery of underweight and acutely malnourished children in northern Salta. Supplements are being \ndistributed through five points (health posts) created for this purpose, adhering to UNICEF distribution \nstandards. \n \nWithin the framework of the Humanitarian Plan of Action developed in conjunction with ECHO, ARC was able \nto secure 200 additional household water filters to expand drought response in affected localities. \n \nOCHA sent two experts to support the Office of the UN Resident Coordinator and strengthen coordination, \nneeds assessment and information management. \n \nArgentine Red Cross works in coordination with local institutions to provide a more tailored response and \navoid duplication. ARC's main strategic partners in the area are Fundaci\u00f3n Pata Pila and Fundapaz. \n \n \nNeeds analysis and scenario planning \n \nHealth: Three more children with symptoms associated with severe dehydration caused by diarrhoea and \nvomiting died during the month of March. Like all the others, these deaths are closely related to acute \nPage | 4 \n \nmalnutrition triggered by the lack of access to drinking water and food. Field assessment teams identified that \n90 per cent of the population assessed presents a below normal nutritional status, registering 45 per cent for \nthe \u201cvery underweight\u201d indicator (per the BMI scale). In addition, 84 per cent of the children assessed have \nexperienced at least one episode of diarrhoea in the previous month. \nWhile dengue cases have not increased significantly in the area, it is important to continue to raise awareness \nabout vector-borne diseases. So far this year, 2201 positive cases of Type 1 dengue have been registered in \nSalta province, mostly in nearby municipalities. None of the cases registered have resulted in death. \n \nThe children's deaths have caused widespread emotional impact to area residents - both to the families of \nthe children who have died as well as to the community at large given the community ties that unite them \n(families live in organized communities under a \"cacicado\" system where everyone is part of a \"big family\" \nstructure). There are signs of severe stress linked to conditions of uncertainty and fear, mainly because they \ndo not know what condition their children are in, but also due to the COVID-19 scenario - which has prevented \nfamilies from engaging in everyday activities, such as attending church and school, and disrupted everyday \nlife - and the mandatory quarantine that continues to be extended every week and prevents them from \nmedium to long-term planning. \n \nWater and sanitation: Access to safe water remains a need. Some communities (around 40 per cent of \nthose surveyed and 20 per cent of surveyed families) do not have access to water due to remote distance of \nwells or rivers, while others have access to low-quality sources. In some cases, there is no access to water \ndistributed via the supply network or people are unable to travel to these. On the other hand, the communities \nthat do have access to water lack containers to store it or transport it to their homes, which exacerbates \nassociated diseases (diarrhoea, dehydration, heat stroke, gastroenteritis, urinary infections, allergies, \nrespiratory issues). The mandatory preventive isolation is an additional factor that is affecting people's ability \nto collect water. \n \nIn terms of sanitation, waste management is virtually non-existent, as improvised garbage dumps spring up \naround the very areas where these communities live; no community has a drainage network; and half use \nlatrines. This is partly attributed to the nomadic nature of several communities, which does not allow for long-\nterm sanitation implementation. Furthermore, many communities\u2019 location far from paved roads hinders \nplanning for a waste collection system. \n \nLivelihoods: The drought has negatively affected access to and availability of water to sustain food sources \n(livestock) produced by communities. The rivers' decreased flows have affected fishing, which communities \nengage in mostly to secure food. Current conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have increasingly \nled to a shortage of resources and stocks for local businesses (roadblocks, limited transport), and people are \nunable to go to work or sell their crafts. Day labourers who were able to get jobs are no longer working due \nto restrictions on agricultural production activities, in accordance with governmental measures. \n \nFood security \n  \nAssessments conducted by the Red Cross team in the field reveal that 65 per cent of children went without \nfood at least once during the week, and 53 per cent were able to eat only once a day. Food bag distributions \nhave been suspended due to the pandemic, and the dining halls and canteens that usually operate in schools \nare closed as well. This has forced families to reduce their number of food rations, mainly affecting vulnerable \ngroups such as children under the age of five, women who are pregnant, the elderly and people with acute \nand chronic diseases. They also look for ways to travel to cities to collect their pensions and subsidies to buy \nfood. \n \nOperation Risk Assessment \n \nBecause of the pandemic, communities set up roadblocks and closed the main access roads to the areas \naffected by the emergency, which during the first stage of the operation hindered staff movement on the \nground. The Argentine Red Cross coordination team met several times with community leaders to reach an \nagreement that would allow teams to travel freely along the roads; however, road closures and similar \nrestrictions still constitute a potential operational risk. \n \nWhile volunteer team rotations varied based on security provisions related to the pandemic, both in terms of \nlength of stay and number of members, the residents of the communities being assisted expressed concern \nregarding these rotations and the people coming in from \"the outside\". This was dealt with through community \nawareness mechanisms, longer-term stays, and by prioritizing local volunteerism, and eventually their \nconcerns decreased. In subsequent conversations with caciques and other community members, they \nPage | 5 \n \nexpressed their approval for the ARC camp, since they see Red Cross members as health agents who provide \nassistance to the population and contribute to their COVID-19 prevention actions. It is necessary to follow-up \non certain situations and monitor rumours where necessary. \n \nDuring the course of the operation, several ARC vehicles assisting with response suffered mechanical failures \ndue to bad road and weather conditions (temperatures above 48\u00b0C on occasions).  \n \nScenario \nHumanitarian consequence \nPotential Response \nCOVID-19. \nIncrease in the number \nof confirmed cases in \nSalta province, \npotentially coming to \nassisted communities. \nHigh rate of contagion due to pre-\nexisting precarious social and \nhealth conditions in communities, \ncausing significant impact to \noperational activities.  \nARC has prepared an action protocol in the event a \npositive case of COVID-19 is detected in the area, \nwhich immediately reduces the possibility of \ntransmission in communities and isolates the \nsuspected case at the Santa Victoria Este hospital. \nActivities in relation to access to the population will \nbe adjusted. \nOverflowing of the \nPilcomayo river \nDamage to housing located near \nthe river and within the floodplain, \npossibly requiring evacuation from \nthe area. \nSupport to province and municipal governments \nwith community evacuations, with possible \nevacuation of base camp. \n \nRoad closure and \ncommunity perception \nFree movement of volunteers and \nhumanitarian aid elements is \nimpossible, and validation and \nacceptance by communities is \njeopardized. \nAwareness talks are organized with leaders to \nexplain our processes. Dialogue with local \nauthorities and community leaders to allow ARC \nvehicles to pass \n \n \nB. Operational strategy \n \nOverall Operational Objective \n \nTo reduce the impact of humanitarian needs caused by the prolonged drought in Salta province through \nactions that reduce negative survival strategies, improve access to drinking water, and nutritional surveillance \nwith a gender perspective.  \n \nARC's EPoA includes actions to support 4,000 vulnerable people in the municipalities of Santa Victoria Este \nand General Ballivian in northern Salta in terms of health care, livelihoods and water and hygiene. \n \n \nOPERATIONAL SUPPORT \n \nHuman resources: All deployed personnel have life and personal accident insurance in accordance with \nArgentine legislation, and institutional staff has work-risk insurance. \n \nSo far, 9 national intervention team (NIT) members, 4 headquarters staff and 52 volunteers from branches in \nLuj\u00e1n, La Plata, Mar del Plata, Necochea, Rosario, Saavedra, Salta, San Andr\u00e9s, San Juan, San Rafael, \nSanta Fe, Santiago del Estero, Santos Lugares, Tucum\u00e1n, and Villa Crespo have been deployed. \n \nThe COVID-10 context has generated extra documentation, requiring a health declaration stating that the \nperson has not presented associated symptoms in the 14 days prior to deployment as well as another stating \nthat the person has not come into close contact with suspected cases. Related protocols and procedures and \na permanent surveillance system have been incorporated. The pandemic has made it difficult to mobilize \nvolunteers, requiring them to stay for longer periods of time to reduce the virus' circulation and prioritizing \nlocal volunteerism. \n \nLogistics and supply chain: All of the National Society's logistical resources have been made available \nsince the beginning of the operation, and the humanitarian logistics area at Headquarters has been working \nactively since then as well. However, the COVID-19 action plan has required sharing logistical support \nresources, such as transportation, to implement the operation. \n \nPage | 6 \n \nAgreements were established with the Aeropuerto 2000 agency, which has provided storage space at Ezeiza \nInternational Airport to be used as an extra warehouse. Likewise, it should be noted that the logistics team \nhad to devote time to purchasing and acquisition processes for the action plan mentioned above. \n \nThe assistance provided by the IFRC RLU to acquire the humanitarian aid that is currently being distributed \nin the field has been essential for the Plan of Action's implementation. Also, with their support, ARC has \nacquired 1600 jerrycans (sent from Panama), 800 hygiene kits (which are scheduled to arrive soon), 4 \nbladders, and 800 household water filters and 16 community water filters (sent from the United Kingdom). \n \nOther important pandemic-related issues to consider are the closed roads, restricted transport of cargo and \nthe border closures (both commercial and personal). \n \nIt is important to note that transportation costs have been high due to: \n\u2022 \nThe distance between the location from which resources are deployed and the field. \n\u2022 \nThe difficult access, and therefore the need to have specific vehicles and equipment. \n\u2022 \nIncreased maintenance costs for cell phones and resources due to the distances travelled over rough \nterrain.  \n \nThe following material resources have been deployed to the field: \n \nResources \nQuantity \n4x4 trucks, double cab  \n4 \n4x2 trucks, double cab  \n2 \nUtility truck  \n2 \nUnmanned aerial vehicle (drone)  \n1 \nBackpacks and first aid kits  \n7 \nVHF communication equipment  \n20 \nWASH kit (for source evaluation) \n1 \nSafety equipment for volunteers  \n30 \nATVs \n2 \nSemitrailer \n1 \nMotorhome \n1 \nM15 Water Treatment Plant \n1 \nGenerators \n2 \nStructural Tent \n3 \nField tents \n4 \nAwnings \n3 \n \n \n \nInformation technology: Community assessments have been carried out using the ODK platform. Satellite \ntelephony is being used, as many areas in this region of Argentina do not have telephone or communication \nservices. A satellite internet antenna was installed at the camp to support the operation. \n \nCommunications: Images, videos and testimonials have been obtained in coordination with the national \nheadquarters\u2019 communication area and volunteers and personnel deployed in the field, from which various \nmaterials have been created. These have been shared in the media, social networks, and used in \naccountability documents to communities, the government and strategic partners.  \n \nPage | 7 \n \nThe communications team has a four-stage strategy. The first one, which has been completed, was directly \nrelated to the \u201cproblematization of the situation\u201d and positioning the issue in the agenda. The second stage \ninvolved fundraising. The third stage involved visibility, monitoring rumours and producing pieces for the \ncommunity (which is currently underway). The fourth stage involves the compilation of elements that provide \nvisibility to actions and that can be used for accountability to the community, State and strategic partners. \n \nThe following are links to media coverage on the ARC operation: \n \n\u2022 \nhttps://www.diariopopular.com.ar/general/cruz-roja-ayudara-las-comunidades-wichis-y-los-pueblos-\nindigenas-salta-2-millones-litros-agua-n460841 \n\u2022 \nhttps://www.eltribuno.com/salta/nota/2020-2-6-14-3-0-organismos-internacionales-se-suman-a-la-\nagenda-de-intervencion-sociosanitaria-en-el-norte-salteno \n\u2022 \nhttps://www.lanacion.com.ar/comunidad/cruz-roja-se-suma-ayuda-salta-llevar-nid2336185 \n\u2022 \nhttps://www.ellitoral.com/index.php/id_um/226900-la-cruz-roja-argentina-brindara-2-millones-de-litros-\nde-agua-potable-a-salta-en-dos-meses-nacionales.html \n\u2022 \nhttps://www.minutoneuquen.com/nacionales/2020/2/21/ante-la-emergencia-la-cruz-roja-argentina-\nllevara-agua-potable-la-comunidad-wichi-de-salta-189818.html  \n\u2022 \nhttps://www.ambito.com/politica/juan-cabandie/la-cruz-roja-repartira-2-millones-litros-agua-pueblos-\nindigenas-salta-n5084323 \n\u2022 \nhttps://www.telam.com.ar/notas/202002/434160-cruz-roja-argentina-agua-potable-comunidades-wichi-\nsalta.html  \n\u2022 \nhttps://www.pagina12.com.ar/249975-la-cruz-roja-instalara-un-campamento-en-el-chaco-salteno \n\u2022 \nhttps://mundo.sputniknews.com/america-latina/202002071090399016-la-onu-la-ue-y-la-cruz-roja-\nintervienen-en-provincia-argentina-ante-emergencia-sociosanitaria/ \n \nSecurity: Argentine Red Cross ensures Safer Access in all its operations. All volunteers and staff are covered \nby life insurance, work under safety regulations and use the appropriate personal protection equipment. \nConsidering the COVID-19 emergency, specific protocols for action and appropriate use of face mask, gloves, \nsocial distancing, etc. have been established.  \n \nThe Red Cross has a good community acceptance and does not have major issues working in affected areas. \nThe community actively participates in activities carried out by the institution. \n \nA safety plan has been prepared, which is sent to volunteers prior to deployment and reviewed during \ninduction. Upon arrival, volunteers are provided work gloves, an institutional vest, and a biosafety kit \nconsisting of a face mask, goggles and gloves (COVID-19 kit). \n \nPlanning, monitoring, evaluation and reporting: The operation is being coordinated by an Emergency \nOperations Centre set up at the base camp. This EOC is coordinated by the National Response Directorate, \nwhich in turn is responsible for planning the actions to be carried out in the field. This monitoring is carried \nout through spreadsheets and documents that are completed and shared daily and the reports prepared by \noperation leaders (usually members of the national team), which are systematized by the EOC.  \n \nAdministration and finance: Fundraising was activated as soon as the emergency was declared through \nboth conventional and new fundraising mechanisms. The full marketing team, web donation channels and an \nadvertising campaign over the main mass media were activated. On the other hand, a comprehensive and \ngeneral plan was submitted to strategic partners such as large donor companies and Chamber of \nEntrepreneurs for Sustainable Development (CEADS).  \n \nAll funds raised, including this DREF, were consolidated into one single plan and unified budget called \"Salta \n2020 Humanitarian Plan of Action\". It contains short- and medium-term goals, which will be the responsibility \nof the Response Directorate, as well as long-term actions, which will be taken up by the National Directorate \nfor Human Development team. The campaign, which is still underway, has raised 50 per cent of the total \namount necessary to complete all its actions. ARC has private and individual donors collaborating with the \noperation, and Spanish Red Cross contributed with 25,000 Euros. \n \nThe Argentine Red Cross has specific procedures for procurement and accountability in emergency \nsituations, which aim to guarantee transparency in the management of funds allocated for the implementation \nof humanitarian aid actions. In addition, the National Accounting and Administration and Finance Directorates \nwill provide support to the operation through budget monitoring, procurement, expense reports, audits and \nfinancial reports. \n \nIn addition, the National Society maintains annual accounting, which is presented through the Annual Report; \nan independent audit company audits the reports; and there is an internal oversight body.     \nPage | 8 \n \n   \nC.

However, the National Society \nis considering alternative ways of delivering the cash and revising the number of people to be reached. \n \nImplementation activities to cover the basic needs of 300 families / Non- conditional Cash Distribution: The \nNational Society is looking into other methods to provide a quick response, considering the possibility of expanding \nthe target population. \n \nMonitoring, follow-up and satisfaction survey: This activity will be conducted after the cash transfer mechanisms \nare implemented.  \n \nChallenges: Limited market opening and access due to COVID-19 restrictions. \n \nMeasures: Alert mechanisms to support the needs of affected populations are being analysed. \n \n \n \nHealth \nPeople targeted: 4000 \nMale: 2040 \nFemale: 1960 \n   \nHealth Outcome 1: Less severe cases of illness or malnutrition are treated at the community level and \nreferral pathways are established for severe cases \nIndicators: \n \nTarget \nActual \nTraining volunteers in healthy eating and nutritional surveillance \n60 \nIn process \nIdentify procedures for referring children identified as potentially \nmalnourished to health centres \n1 \n1 \nPromotion and awareness of Healthy Eating with a community engagement \nand accountability (CEA) approach \n800 families \nIn process \nNutritional surveillance and referral to the health centre \n800 families \n355 \nHealth Outcome 2: Transmission of diseases with epidemic potential is reduced \nIndicators: \n \nTarget \nActual \nVisits by health personnel from headquarters to assess and monitor the \nhealth situation and coordinate with the authorities \n6 \n10 \nHealth promotion training to volunteers for their integration into the \nemergency response \n30 volunteers \n22 volunteers \nPage | 9 \n \nPreparation and distribution of health promotion material that considers the \nchallenge of native peoples with a CEA approach \n800 families \n556 families \nHealth promotion and vector-borne and communicable diseases \n800 \n556 \nHealth Outcome 3: Psychosocial impacts of the emergency are reduced \nIndicators: \n \nTarget \nActual \nProvide psychosocial support (PSS) to people affected by the emergency \nwith priority given to family of victims \n30 families \n4 \nProvide psychosocial support to staff and volunteers \n120 PSS \nsessions \n60 \nProgress towards outcomes \n \nTraining volunteers in healthy eating and nutritional surveillance: This activity was suspended due to the \nmandatory social isolation measures decreed in Argentina that ban mass gatherings of people. This training has been \nrescheduled for 16 May, which will be provided online by nutrition and food security specialists. \n \nIdentify procedures for referring children identified as potentially malnourished to health centres: A procedure \nto identify at-risk children was developed, which includes criteria to assess the target population for this activity (e.g. \nage, height, weight, community, access to safe water and disabilities). The nursing staff will be responsible for \nreporting and identification, supervised by base camp leaders. Children will be reported and referred to the Santa \nVictoria Este hospital, which is the main health facility in the region. The case must also be reported to the province's \nMinistry of Health, as agreed with the Ministry of the Interior (a reporting protocol and form exist).  \n \nPromotion and awareness of Healthy Eating with an CEA approach: The mandatory isolation measures have \nalso hampered community training because of people's inability to travel; however, micro-recommendations and key \nmessages are provided to the people who come to the infirmary or scheduled distributions. \n \nNutritional surveillance and referral to the health centre: The infirmary has reported 355 visits by various \ncommunity members to seek treatment for various ailments (headaches, wounds, pharyngitis, otitis, colic, lower back \npain, gastroenteritis, labour, seizures, BP and vital signs monitoring). This is very important information for this line \nof action, given that, in the COVID-19 context, it constitutes a source of information, detection, surveillance and \nreferral. As mentioned above, this is done in coordination with the Santa Victoria Este Hospital, which receives the \ncases that are considered serious or require advanced medical monitoring, such as cases of severe malnutrition. A \nprotocol to measure height and weight, which are recorded, is applied in all healthcare services as the main \nsurveillance factor. \n \nOn the other hand, but no less important, at the beginning of the operation, Argentine Red Cross' Humanitarian \nObservatory conducted research into the nutritional status of children in northern Argentina using a representative \nsample.

Four filters have been delivered to health centres in Santa Mar\u00eda, \nMonte Carmelo, La Puntana and Santa Victoria Este. Filters have not been delivered to other community spaces, \nsuch as schools and CICs (Community Integration Centres), as these remain closed because of isolation \nmeasures. So far, 740 filters have been delivered to community families, and distribution is expected to be \ncompleted in the next two days.

Once in Argentina, distribution will begin immediately. \nChallenges: \n\u2022 \nThe COVID-19 pandemic represents one of the main challenges of the operation due to the closing of \ncustoms offices and borders. The delays in the entry of humanitarian aid items plus the closing of certain \npoints between provinces in Argentina delayed their arrival or caused them to arrive in small batches, \nlengthening the supply chain between the capital and the affected areas. \n\u2022 \nThe global situation cause by the pandemic has required reorganizing distributions in emergencies to \ninclude protection measures. Having to comply with social distancing measures slows down the \nhumanitarian aid delivery process. \n\u2022 \nArgentina has banned mass public and community events, making it impossible to hold some community \nworkshops. \n\u2022 \nWhile the town of Santa Victoria Este is not difficult to access, it is far from the main urban centres in northern \nArgentina, which makes it difficult to acquire the items needed for activities and requires transporting enough \nsupplies to the base camp as well as replenishing them on a weekly basis. \nActions to overcome challenges: \n\u2022 \nCommunity distributions and activities are planned in advance, anticipating the number of people \nattending and focusing mainly on complying with COVID-19 protection measures. \n\u2022 \nPersonal protection materials were distributed to volunteers on the ground. \n\u2022 \nA number of minimum safety standards were created for volunteers involved in Argentine Red Cross \nactivities. \n\u2022 \nAn agreement was reached with leaders who maintain the roadblocks, as well as with the appropriate \nauthorities, to allow free movement of Red Cross personnel. \n \n \nProtection, gender and inclusion \nPeople targeted: 4000 \nMale: 2040 \nFemale: 1960   \nProtection, gender and inclusion Outcome 1: Communities become more peaceful, secure and inclusive by \nmeeting the needs and rights of the most vulnerable. \nIndicators: \n \nTarget \nActual \nConduct an assessment of the specific needs of the affected population based \non criteria selected from the minimum standards for PGI in emergencies. \n3 \n1 \nDevelop standard operating procedures for the protection from sexual and \ngender-based violence and the protection of children, including mapping of \nreferral routes. \n1 \n1 \nConduct training in protection, gender and inclusion for volunteers. \n15 volunteers \ntrained \n4 \nSupport sector teams and ensure the collection and analysis of data \ndisaggregated by sex, age and disability \n1 \n1 \nProgress towards outcomes \n \nConduct an assessment of the specific needs of the affected population based on criteria selected from \nthe minimum standards for PGI in emergencies: A first report of the initial surveys of the different lines of the \nPlan has been prepared.

The assessment has also detected the main cultural \nbarriers, mostly related to gender and the asymmetric power relations between families and individuals; however, \npositive results from these evaluations have been linked to the presence of women (although few) in spheres of \npower and leadership.. \n \nDevelop standard operating procedures for the protection from sexual and gender-based violence and the \nprotection of children, including mapping of referral routes: This was done at they beginning of the operation, \nPage | 17 \n \nand must be harmonized for the current COVID-19 isolation context.

Movement restriction measures have affected \nmobilization on the ground and the implementation of activities in indigenous Wichi, Chorotes and Tobas \ncommunities in Salta province that are central to the planned activities in livelihoods, community awareness, \nnutritional surveillance, and water and hygiene. Argentine Red Cross (ARC) will continue to provide assistance \nbased on its ability to reach the affected population and following government-issued regulations; however, there \nwill be greater operational implementation challenges if restrictions continue. \n \nA. Situation analysis \n \nDescription of the disaster \n \nOn 20 January 2020, the government of province of Salta in \nArgentina declared a Social and Health Emergency for its north-\neastern regions due to the death of 8 children and the \nhospitalization of 30 others due to malnutrition, especially in \nindigenous communities in the departments of Rivadavia, San \nMart\u00edn and Or\u00e1n. Dozens of other children in areas under \nemergency were hospitalized, and some discharged, due to \ngastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses aggravated by their \nacute state of malnutrition and dehydration. Salta's Ministry of \nHealth has reported 855 cases of acute malnutrition in children \nunder five years of age and more than 10,000 at-risk cases in \nthe three departments under the emergency declaration. One of \nthe origins of this situation is the seasonal drought that began in \nthe last quarter of 2019 and intensified in February, which \ndirectly affected people's quality of life due to low food \nproduction, impact on livestock and, consequently, a significant \ndecrease in people's daily food consumption. \n \nArgentine Red Cross (ARC) began to provide assistance in the \nmost affected areas immediately after the declaration of \nemergency. The Argentine Red Cross Humanitarian Observatory conducted a field assessment that identified \n \nOperation Update \nArgentina: Drought \nThe Argentine Red Cross (ARC) established a \nfirst aid attention at the base camp in Mission \nGrande, Salta. Source: ARC \nPage | 2 \n \nthat 90 per cent of the population evaluated had a below normal nutritional status, registering 45 per cent for \nthe \u201cvery underweight\u201d indicator, using the Body Mass Index (BMI) scale. In addition, 84 per cent of the \nchildren assessed had experienced at least one episode of diarrhoea in the previous month linked to hygiene \nhabits and access to safe water. The National Society established a camp in the area to continue assisting \ncommunities and populations through health, water, hygiene and livelihood actions. \n \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has made access to health services more complex, as the significant distance \nbetween communities and health centres has been compounded by the closing of access roads and the \ndecrease in traffic. In addition to the reduced staff in health centres, prioritization is given to people with \nCOVID-19 symptoms and regular consult services remain suspended. As for the already limited water or \nelectricity supply services, all municipal staff are working reduced hours, which minimizes access and ability \nto solve problems. \n \n \nSummary of the current response \n \nOverview of Host National Society  \n \nArgentine Red Cross, with support from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent \nSocieties (IFRC), is responding to the emergency in the town of Santa Victoria Este, located 540 km from the \ncity of Salta. It was decided to set up a base camp in the Misi\u00f3n Grande area, approximately 15 km from \nSanta Victoria Este, from which it is able to provide response to more than 38 indigenous Wichis, Chorotes \nand Tobas communities. \n \nThe National Society established the first humanitarian camp in ARC's history, within which the National \nResponse Directorate activated an Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) to coordinate actions on the ground. \nThe camp has an operations centre, a first aid post, telecommunications, a logistics area, fleet, training rooms, \nkitchen, dining area, water supply and sanitation for communities. \n \nPrior to rolling out the operation, the field team met with more than 35 chieftains (caciques) and community \nleaders to socialize the planed operational actions that ARC would implement and to explain the Movement's \nmission and fundamental principles. These communities members\u2019 expressed a high level of acceptance and \ndemonstrated positive engagement in the pre-implementation processes.  \n \nThe National Society has provided support and care in the following aspects: \n \n\u2022 \nMore than 30 water assessments conducted at different collection points \n\u2022 \n4,000 individuals surveyed regarding household needs, using Open Data Kit (ODK)   \n\u2022 \n330 first aid services provided \n\u2022 \n556 household water filters distributed \n\u2022 \n740 jerrycans distributed \n \nSince the beginning of the operation, Argentine Red Cross, together with OCHA, IOM, UNHCR, UNICEF, the \nArgentine Army and ECHO, has been part of the coordination working group, convened by the Office of the \nUnited Nations Resident Coordinator that create a Global Action Plan that unites the actions of all these \norganizations. The working group maintains joint work and regular meetings (online in the COVID-19 context) \nwith the organizations, which are developing their specific action plans, and especially with the Argentine \nArmy on the ground to coordinate water distributions. \n \nOverview of Red Cross Red Crescent Movement in country \n \nPrior to the approval of this DREF operation, a surge Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion (WASH) \nspecialist was deployed to assist with assessment of communities' water sources and identify factors to \ncontribute to the WASH implementation strategy. \n \nThrough the IFRC Regional Logistic Unit (RLU), the National Society acquired bladders, jerrycans, household \nand community water filters, and hygiene kits (which are pending arrival). The latter were ultimately requested \nvia the RLU due to the significant increase in price in the country. The RLU also assisted with the shipping, \nquoting, purchasing and custom clearance processes. \nWithin the framework of the Plan of Action, Spanish Red Cross sent an a M15 Emergency Response Unit \n(ERU M15 with a Purification Line) to the country. It arrived in late April, has been set up and is in operation \nin the field. Simultaneously, 1600 jerrycans are being distributed to carry water from the plant or distribution \nPage | 3 \n \nbladders. Spanish Red Cross also donated 25,000 Euros to implement the operation and set up the base \ncamp. \n \n \n \nThe Spanish Red Cross donated a M15 Water Treatment Plant for this operation, as shown in the \npictures during its arrival in Ezeiza Airport Humanitarian Hub in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Source: \nArgentine Red Cross \n \nThe head of the IFRC Country Cluster Support Team (CCST) for the Southern Cone and Brazil has provided \ndirect and ongoing support to all planning and coordination processes by both the Red Cross and government \n(national and province) and external agencies. In addition, the IFRC Disaster Management coordinator and \nfinancial coordinator are providing support to the operation. \n \nOverview of non-RCRC actors in country \n \nSince 22 January 2020, the Argentine Army has been working in Santa Victoria Este, specifically in the \u201cEl \nRosado\u201d area, with a commission of water specialists from the V Mountain Brigade's engineering battalion, \nwhich has put into operation an M-11 water treatment plant with the capacity to produce 9000 litres per hour, \nproviding access to safe water in more than 15 communities in the area. \n \nSalta's Ministry of Public Health, with support from the National Ministry of Health, is assisting the Santa \nVictoria Este Hospital with reinforcements (medical/nursing personnel), basic ward equipment and a four-\nwheel drive ambulance to provide health care access to communities in the area. \n \nSalta's Ministry of Social Development was distributing monthly basic food kits to families affected by the \nemergency. Restrictions related to the pandemic interrupted this activity. \n \nThe Ministry of Public Health began an influenza vaccination campaign on 2 April, distributing 3,550 doses \nallocated to the Santa Victoria Este/Rivadavia area, which are being administered to targeted beneficiaries \nat their homes. On 3 April, the province government delivered six medium-complexity ambulances to \nstrengthen efforts in localities affected by the social and health emergency. \n \nOn 7 April, UNICEF delivered 1,000 nutritional supplements to the province to assist with the nutritional \nrecovery of underweight and acutely malnourished children in northern Salta. Supplements are being \ndistributed through five points (health posts) created for this purpose, adhering to UNICEF distribution \nstandards. \n \nWithin the framework of the Humanitarian Plan of Action developed in conjunction with ECHO, ARC was able \nto secure 200 additional household water filters to expand drought response in affected localities. \n \nOCHA sent two experts to support the Office of the UN Resident Coordinator and strengthen coordination, \nneeds assessment and information management. \n \nArgentine Red Cross works in coordination with local institutions to provide a more tailored response and \navoid duplication. ARC's main strategic partners in the area are Fundaci\u00f3n Pata Pila and Fundapaz. \n \n \nNeeds analysis and scenario planning \n \nHealth: Three more children with symptoms associated with severe dehydration caused by diarrhoea and \nvomiting died during the month of March. Like all the others, these deaths are closely related to acute \nPage | 4 \n \nmalnutrition triggered by the lack of access to drinking water and food. Field assessment teams identified that \n90 per cent of the population assessed presents a below normal nutritional status, registering 45 per cent for \nthe \u201cvery underweight\u201d indicator (per the BMI scale). In addition, 84 per cent of the children assessed have \nexperienced at least one episode of diarrhoea in the previous month. \nWhile dengue cases have not increased significantly in the area, it is important to continue to raise awareness \nabout vector-borne diseases. So far this year, 2201 positive cases of Type 1 dengue have been registered in \nSalta province, mostly in nearby municipalities. None of the cases registered have resulted in death. \n \nThe children's deaths have caused widespread emotional impact to area residents - both to the families of \nthe children who have died as well as to the community at large given the community ties that unite them \n(families live in organized communities under a \"cacicado\" system where everyone is part of a \"big family\" \nstructure). There are signs of severe stress linked to conditions of uncertainty and fear, mainly because they \ndo not know what condition their children are in, but also due to the COVID-19 scenario - which has prevented \nfamilies from engaging in everyday activities, such as attending church and school, and disrupted everyday \nlife - and the mandatory quarantine that continues to be extended every week and prevents them from \nmedium to long-term planning. \n \nWater and sanitation: Access to safe water remains a need. Some communities (around 40 per cent of \nthose surveyed and 20 per cent of surveyed families) do not have access to water due to remote distance of \nwells or rivers, while others have access to low-quality sources. In some cases, there is no access to water \ndistributed via the supply network or people are unable to travel to these. On the other hand, the communities \nthat do have access to water lack containers to store it or transport it to their homes, which exacerbates \nassociated diseases (diarrhoea, dehydration, heat stroke, gastroenteritis, urinary infections, allergies, \nrespiratory issues). The mandatory preventive isolation is an additional factor that is affecting people's ability \nto collect water. \n \nIn terms of sanitation, waste management is virtually non-existent, as improvised garbage dumps spring up \naround the very areas where these communities live; no community has a drainage network; and half use \nlatrines. This is partly attributed to the nomadic nature of several communities, which does not allow for long-\nterm sanitation implementation. Furthermore, many communities\u2019 location far from paved roads hinders \nplanning for a waste collection system. \n \nLivelihoods: The drought has negatively affected access to and availability of water to sustain food sources \n(livestock) produced by communities. The rivers' decreased flows have affected fishing, which communities \nengage in mostly to secure food. Current conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have increasingly \nled to a shortage of resources and stocks for local businesses (roadblocks, limited transport), and people are \nunable to go to work or sell their crafts. Day labourers who were able to get jobs are no longer working due \nto restrictions on agricultural production activities, in accordance with governmental measures. \n \nFood security \n  \nAssessments conducted by the Red Cross team in the field reveal that 65 per cent of children went without \nfood at least once during the week, and 53 per cent were able to eat only once a day. Food bag distributions \nhave been suspended due to the pandemic, and the dining halls and canteens that usually operate in schools \nare closed as well. This has forced families to reduce their number of food rations, mainly affecting vulnerable \ngroups such as children under the age of five, women who are pregnant, the elderly and people with acute \nand chronic diseases. They also look for ways to travel to cities to collect their pensions and subsidies to buy \nfood. \n \nOperation Risk Assessment \n \nBecause of the pandemic, communities set up roadblocks and closed the main access roads to the areas \naffected by the emergency, which during the first stage of the operation hindered staff movement on the \nground. The Argentine Red Cross coordination team met several times with community leaders to reach an \nagreement that would allow teams to travel freely along the roads; however, road closures and similar \nrestrictions still constitute a potential operational risk. \n \nWhile volunteer team rotations varied based on security provisions related to the pandemic, both in terms of \nlength of stay and number of members, the residents of the communities being assisted expressed concern \nregarding these rotations and the people coming in from \"the outside\". This was dealt with through community \nawareness mechanisms, longer-term stays, and by prioritizing local volunteerism, and eventually their \nconcerns decreased. In subsequent conversations with caciques and other community members, they \nPage | 5 \n \nexpressed their approval for the ARC camp, since they see Red Cross members as health agents who provide \nassistance to the population and contribute to their COVID-19 prevention actions. It is necessary to follow-up \non certain situations and monitor rumours where necessary. \n \nDuring the course of the operation, several ARC vehicles assisting with response suffered mechanical failures \ndue to bad road and weather conditions (temperatures above 48\u00b0C on occasions).  \n \nScenario \nHumanitarian consequence \nPotential Response \nCOVID-19. \nIncrease in the number \nof confirmed cases in \nSalta province, \npotentially coming to \nassisted communities. \nHigh rate of contagion due to pre-\nexisting precarious social and \nhealth conditions in communities, \ncausing significant impact to \noperational activities.  \nARC has prepared an action protocol in the event a \npositive case of COVID-19 is detected in the area, \nwhich immediately reduces the possibility of \ntransmission in communities and isolates the \nsuspected case at the Santa Victoria Este hospital. \nActivities in relation to access to the population will \nbe adjusted. \nOverflowing of the \nPilcomayo river \nDamage to housing located near \nthe river and within the floodplain, \npossibly requiring evacuation from \nthe area. \nSupport to province and municipal governments \nwith community evacuations, with possible \nevacuation of base camp. \n \nRoad closure and \ncommunity perception \nFree movement of volunteers and \nhumanitarian aid elements is \nimpossible, and validation and \nacceptance by communities is \njeopardized. \nAwareness talks are organized with leaders to \nexplain our processes. Dialogue with local \nauthorities and community leaders to allow ARC \nvehicles to pass \n \n \nB. Operational strategy \n \nOverall Operational Objective \n \nTo reduce the impact of humanitarian needs caused by the prolonged drought in Salta province through \nactions that reduce negative survival strategies, improve access to drinking water, and nutritional surveillance \nwith a gender perspective.  \n \nARC's EPoA includes actions to support 4,000 vulnerable people in the municipalities of Santa Victoria Este \nand General Ballivian in northern Salta in terms of health care, livelihoods and water and hygiene. \n \n \nOPERATIONAL SUPPORT \n \nHuman resources: All deployed personnel have life and personal accident insurance in accordance with \nArgentine legislation, and institutional staff has work-risk insurance. \n \nSo far, 9 national intervention team (NIT) members, 4 headquarters staff and 52 volunteers from branches in \nLuj\u00e1n, La Plata, Mar del Plata, Necochea, Rosario, Saavedra, Salta, San Andr\u00e9s, San Juan, San Rafael, \nSanta Fe, Santiago del Estero, Santos Lugares, Tucum\u00e1n, and Villa Crespo have been deployed. \n \nThe COVID-10 context has generated extra documentation, requiring a health declaration stating that the \nperson has not presented associated symptoms in the 14 days prior to deployment as well as another stating \nthat the person has not come into close contact with suspected cases. Related protocols and procedures and \na permanent surveillance system have been incorporated. The pandemic has made it difficult to mobilize \nvolunteers, requiring them to stay for longer periods of time to reduce the virus' circulation and prioritizing \nlocal volunteerism. \n \nLogistics and supply chain: All of the National Society's logistical resources have been made available \nsince the beginning of the operation, and the humanitarian logistics area at Headquarters has been working \nactively since then as well. However, the COVID-19 action plan has required sharing logistical support \nresources, such as transportation, to implement the operation. \n \nPage | 6 \n \nAgreements were established with the Aeropuerto 2000 agency, which has provided storage space at Ezeiza \nInternational Airport to be used as an extra warehouse. Likewise, it should be noted that the logistics team \nhad to devote time to purchasing and acquisition processes for the action plan mentioned above. \n \nThe assistance provided by the IFRC RLU to acquire the humanitarian aid that is currently being distributed \nin the field has been essential for the Plan of Action's implementation. Also, with their support, ARC has \nacquired 1600 jerrycans (sent from Panama), 800 hygiene kits (which are scheduled to arrive soon), 4 \nbladders, and 800 household water filters and 16 community water filters (sent from the United Kingdom). \n \nOther important pandemic-related issues to consider are the closed roads, restricted transport of cargo and \nthe border closures (both commercial and personal). \n \nIt is important to note that transportation costs have been high due to: \n\u2022 \nThe distance between the location from which resources are deployed and the field. \n\u2022 \nThe difficult access, and therefore the need to have specific vehicles and equipment. \n\u2022 \nIncreased maintenance costs for cell phones and resources due to the distances travelled over rough \nterrain.  \n \nThe following material resources have been deployed to the field: \n \nResources \nQuantity \n4x4 trucks, double cab  \n4 \n4x2 trucks, double cab  \n2 \nUtility truck  \n2 \nUnmanned aerial vehicle (drone)  \n1 \nBackpacks and first aid kits  \n7 \nVHF communication equipment  \n20 \nWASH kit (for source evaluation) \n1 \nSafety equipment for volunteers  \n30 \nATVs \n2 \nSemitrailer \n1 \nMotorhome \n1 \nM15 Water Treatment Plant \n1 \nGenerators \n2 \nStructural Tent \n3 \nField tents \n4 \nAwnings \n3 \n \n \n \nInformation technology: Community assessments have been carried out using the ODK platform. Satellite \ntelephony is being used, as many areas in this region of Argentina do not have telephone or communication \nservices. A satellite internet antenna was installed at the camp to support the operation. \n \nCommunications: Images, videos and testimonials have been obtained in coordination with the national \nheadquarters\u2019 communication area and volunteers and personnel deployed in the field, from which various \nmaterials have been created. These have been shared in the media, social networks, and used in \naccountability documents to communities, the government and strategic partners.  \n \nPage | 7 \n \nThe communications team has a four-stage strategy. The first one, which has been completed, was directly \nrelated to the \u201cproblematization of the situation\u201d and positioning the issue in the agenda. The second stage \ninvolved fundraising. The third stage involved visibility, monitoring rumours and producing pieces for the \ncommunity (which is currently underway). The fourth stage involves the compilation of elements that provide \nvisibility to actions and that can be used for accountability to the community, State and strategic partners. \n \nThe following are links to media coverage on the ARC operation: \n \n\u2022 \nhttps://www.diariopopular.com.ar/general/cruz-roja-ayudara-las-comunidades-wichis-y-los-pueblos-\nindigenas-salta-2-millones-litros-agua-n460841 \n\u2022 \nhttps://www.eltribuno.com/salta/nota/2020-2-6-14-3-0-organismos-internacionales-se-suman-a-la-\nagenda-de-intervencion-sociosanitaria-en-el-norte-salteno \n\u2022 \nhttps://www.lanacion.com.ar/comunidad/cruz-roja-se-suma-ayuda-salta-llevar-nid2336185 \n\u2022 \nhttps://www.ellitoral.com/index.php/id_um/226900-la-cruz-roja-argentina-brindara-2-millones-de-litros-\nde-agua-potable-a-salta-en-dos-meses-nacionales.html \n\u2022 \nhttps://www.minutoneuquen.com/nacionales/2020/2/21/ante-la-emergencia-la-cruz-roja-argentina-\nllevara-agua-potable-la-comunidad-wichi-de-salta-189818.html  \n\u2022 \nhttps://www.ambito.com/politica/juan-cabandie/la-cruz-roja-repartira-2-millones-litros-agua-pueblos-\nindigenas-salta-n5084323 \n\u2022 \nhttps://www.telam.com.ar/notas/202002/434160-cruz-roja-argentina-agua-potable-comunidades-wichi-\nsalta.html  \n\u2022 \nhttps://www.pagina12.com.ar/249975-la-cruz-roja-instalara-un-campamento-en-el-chaco-salteno \n\u2022 \nhttps://mundo.sputniknews.com/america-latina/202002071090399016-la-onu-la-ue-y-la-cruz-roja-\nintervienen-en-provincia-argentina-ante-emergencia-sociosanitaria/ \n \nSecurity: Argentine Red Cross ensures Safer Access in all its operations. All volunteers and staff are covered \nby life insurance, work under safety regulations and use the appropriate personal protection equipment. \nConsidering the COVID-19 emergency, specific protocols for action and appropriate use of face mask, gloves, \nsocial distancing, etc. have been established.  \n \nThe Red Cross has a good community acceptance and does not have major issues working in affected areas. \nThe community actively participates in activities carried out by the institution. \n \nA safety plan has been prepared, which is sent to volunteers prior to deployment and reviewed during \ninduction. Upon arrival, volunteers are provided work gloves, an institutional vest, and a biosafety kit \nconsisting of a face mask, goggles and gloves (COVID-19 kit). \n \nPlanning, monitoring, evaluation and reporting: The operation is being coordinated by an Emergency \nOperations Centre set up at the base camp. This EOC is coordinated by the National Response Directorate, \nwhich in turn is responsible for planning the actions to be carried out in the field. This monitoring is carried \nout through spreadsheets and documents that are completed and shared daily and the reports prepared by \noperation leaders (usually members of the national team), which are systematized by the EOC.  \n \nAdministration and finance: Fundraising was activated as soon as the emergency was declared through \nboth conventional and new fundraising mechanisms. The full marketing team, web donation channels and an \nadvertising campaign over the main mass media were activated. On the other hand, a comprehensive and \ngeneral plan was submitted to strategic partners such as large donor companies and Chamber of \nEntrepreneurs for Sustainable Development (CEADS).  \n \nAll funds raised, including this DREF, were consolidated into one single plan and unified budget called \"Salta \n2020 Humanitarian Plan of Action\". It contains short- and medium-term goals, which will be the responsibility \nof the Response Directorate, as well as long-term actions, which will be taken up by the National Directorate \nfor Human Development team. The campaign, which is still underway, has raised 50 per cent of the total \namount necessary to complete all its actions. ARC has private and individual donors collaborating with the \noperation, and Spanish Red Cross contributed with 25,000 Euros. \n \nThe Argentine Red Cross has specific procedures for procurement and accountability in emergency \nsituations, which aim to guarantee transparency in the management of funds allocated for the implementation \nof humanitarian aid actions. In addition, the National Accounting and Administration and Finance Directorates \nwill provide support to the operation through budget monitoring, procurement, expense reports, audits and \nfinancial reports. \n \nIn addition, the National Society maintains annual accounting, which is presented through the Annual Report; \nan independent audit company audits the reports; and there is an internal oversight body.     \nPage | 8 \n \n   \nC.

However, the National Society \nis considering alternative ways of delivering the cash and revising the number of people to be reached. \n \nImplementation activities to cover the basic needs of 300 families / Non- conditional Cash Distribution: The \nNational Society is looking into other methods to provide a quick response, considering the possibility of expanding \nthe target population. \n \nMonitoring, follow-up and satisfaction survey: This activity will be conducted after the cash transfer mechanisms \nare implemented.  \n \nChallenges: Limited market opening and access due to COVID-19 restrictions. \n \nMeasures: Alert mechanisms to support the needs of affected populations are being analysed. \n \n \n \nHealth \nPeople targeted: 4000 \nMale: 2040 \nFemale: 1960 \n   \nHealth Outcome 1: Less severe cases of illness or malnutrition are treated at the community level and \nreferral pathways are established for severe cases \nIndicators: \n \nTarget \nActual \nTraining volunteers in healthy eating and nutritional surveillance \n60 \nIn process \nIdentify procedures for referring children identified as potentially \nmalnourished to health centres \n1 \n1 \nPromotion and awareness of Healthy Eating with a community engagement \nand accountability (CEA) approach \n800 families \nIn process \nNutritional surveillance and referral to the health centre \n800 families \n355 \nHealth Outcome 2: Transmission of diseases with epidemic potential is reduced \nIndicators: \n \nTarget \nActual \nVisits by health personnel from headquarters to assess and monitor the \nhealth situation and coordinate with the authorities \n6 \n10 \nHealth promotion training to volunteers for their integration into the \nemergency response \n30 volunteers \n22 volunteers \nPage | 9 \n \nPreparation and distribution of health promotion material that considers the \nchallenge of native peoples with a CEA approach \n800 families \n556 families \nHealth promotion and vector-borne and communicable diseases \n800 \n556 \nHealth Outcome 3: Psychosocial impacts of the emergency are reduced \nIndicators: \n \nTarget \nActual \nProvide psychosocial support (PSS) to people affected by the emergency \nwith priority given to family of victims \n30 families \n4 \nProvide psychosocial support to staff and volunteers \n120 PSS \nsessions \n60 \nProgress towards outcomes \n \nTraining volunteers in healthy eating and nutritional surveillance: This activity was suspended due to the \nmandatory social isolation measures decreed in Argentina that ban mass gatherings of people. This training has been \nrescheduled for 16 May, which will be provided online by nutrition and food security specialists. \n \nIdentify procedures for referring children identified as potentially malnourished to health centres: A procedure \nto identify at-risk children was developed, which includes criteria to assess the target population for this activity (e.g. \nage, height, weight, community, access to safe water and disabilities). The nursing staff will be responsible for \nreporting and identification, supervised by base camp leaders. Children will be reported and referred to the Santa \nVictoria Este hospital, which is the main health facility in the region. The case must also be reported to the province's \nMinistry of Health, as agreed with the Ministry of the Interior (a reporting protocol and form exist).  \n \nPromotion and awareness of Healthy Eating with an CEA approach: The mandatory isolation measures have \nalso hampered community training because of people's inability to travel; however, micro-recommendations and key \nmessages are provided to the people who come to the infirmary or scheduled distributions. \n \nNutritional surveillance and referral to the health centre: The infirmary has reported 355 visits by various \ncommunity members to seek treatment for various ailments (headaches, wounds, pharyngitis, otitis, colic, lower back \npain, gastroenteritis, labour, seizures, BP and vital signs monitoring). This is very important information for this line \nof action, given that, in the COVID-19 context, it constitutes a source of information, detection, surveillance and \nreferral. As mentioned above, this is done in coordination with the Santa Victoria Este Hospital, which receives the \ncases that are considered serious or require advanced medical monitoring, such as cases of severe malnutrition.

Each distribution was accompanied by at least two health- and \nwater and sanitation-related training spaces. Four filters have been delivered to health centres in Santa Mar\u00eda, \nMonte Carmelo, La Puntana and Santa Victoria Este. Filters have not been delivered to other community spaces, \nsuch as schools and CICs (Community Integration Centres), as these remain closed because of isolation \nmeasures. So far, 740 filters have been delivered to community families, and distribution is expected to be \ncompleted in the next two days.

Once in Argentina, distribution will begin immediately. \nChallenges: \n\u2022 \nThe COVID-19 pandemic represents one of the main challenges of the operation due to the closing of \ncustoms offices and borders. The delays in the entry of humanitarian aid items plus the closing of certain \npoints between provinces in Argentina delayed their arrival or caused them to arrive in small batches, \nlengthening the supply chain between the capital and the affected areas. \n\u2022 \nThe global situation cause by the pandemic has required reorganizing distributions in emergencies to \ninclude protection measures. Having to comply with social distancing measures slows down the \nhumanitarian aid delivery process. \n\u2022 \nArgentina has banned mass public and community events, making it impossible to hold some community \nworkshops. \n\u2022 \nWhile the town of Santa Victoria Este is not difficult to access, it is far from the main urban centres in northern \nArgentina, which makes it difficult to acquire the items needed for activities and requires transporting enough \nsupplies to the base camp as well as replenishing them on a weekly basis. \nActions to overcome challenges: \n\u2022 \nCommunity distributions and activities are planned in advance, anticipating the number of people \nattending and focusing mainly on complying with COVID-19 protection measures. \n\u2022 \nPersonal protection materials were distributed to volunteers on the ground. \n\u2022 \nA number of minimum safety standards were created for volunteers involved in Argentine Red Cross \nactivities. \n\u2022 \nAn agreement was reached with leaders who maintain the roadblocks, as well as with the appropriate \nauthorities, to allow free movement of Red Cross personnel. \n \n \nProtection, gender and inclusion \nPeople targeted: 4000 \nMale: 2040 \nFemale: 1960   \nProtection, gender and inclusion Outcome 1: Communities become more peaceful, secure and inclusive by \nmeeting the needs and rights of the most vulnerable. \nIndicators: \n \nTarget \nActual \nConduct an assessment of the specific needs of the affected population based \non criteria selected from the minimum standards for PGI in emergencies. \n3 \n1 \nDevelop standard operating procedures for the protection from sexual and \ngender-based violence and the protection of children, including mapping of \nreferral routes. \n1 \n1 \nConduct training in protection, gender and inclusion for volunteers. \n15 volunteers \ntrained \n4 \nSupport sector teams and ensure the collection and analysis of data \ndisaggregated by sex, age and disability \n1 \n1 \nProgress towards outcomes \n \nConduct an assessment of the specific needs of the affected population based on criteria selected from \nthe minimum standards for PGI in emergencies: A first report of the initial surveys of the different lines of the \nPlan has been prepared. The referral strategy should be redesigned given the context of isolation and the closure \nof government structures, such as Social Development. The assessment has also detected the main cultural \nbarriers, mostly related to gender and the asymmetric power relations between families and individuals; however, \npositive results from these evaluations have been linked to the presence of women (although few) in spheres of \npower and leadership.. \n \nDevelop standard operating procedures for the protection from sexual and gender-based violence and the \nprotection of children, including mapping of referral routes: This was done at they beginning of the operation, \nPage | 17 \n \nand must be harmonized for the current COVID-19 isolation context.

Situation analysis \n \nDescription of the disaster  \n \nDPRK is currently experiencing a challenging food insecurity situation. Unusually little precipitation during the winter and \nspring so far is posing a serious threat to the spring harvest, at a time when the harvest in 2018 was the worst in a \ndecade. \n \nDPRK is suffering from droughts that have occurred consecutively in recent years. In 2014, a dry spell that persisted for \nover 18 months caused drought, affecting agricultural production and access to water, and left 18 million public \ndistribution system (PDS) dependents at risk of food insecurity, malnutrition and illness. In June 2017, the Government \ndeclared a national emergency following a dry spell that affected key food producing provinces in the south-west of the \ncountry. The 2017 dry spell stressed the early season crops and constrained planting and early growth of main season \ncrops. The Government mobilized communities and resources to provide irrigation, to reduce any impact from the dry \nspell. In 2018, emergency response was declared due to unusual high temperature and drought. The response of the \nGovernment and Red Cross Society of DPRK was focused on preserving the crops from the heatwave and drought like \nweather conditions. \n \nEntering 2019, DPRK has experienced unusually erratic weather conditions with little precipitation, limiting the soil \nmoisture for growth of winter and planting of spring crops as well as replenishment of water reservoirs for irrigation. The \ntemperatures over the last couple of months have also been higher than normal. Early spring precipitation has so far \nnot been enough to redress the imbalance and only very good late spring/early summer rains will do so. The conditions \nfor soil moisture and irrigation are at an alarming level. The current lack of precipitation and soil moisture will not only \naffect winter and spring-planted crops, but also the planting of subsistence crop as well as the main crop to be harvested \nin September. \n \n \nEmergency Plan of Action (EPoA) \nDPR Korea: Drought and Food Insecurity  \nP a g e  | 2 \n \n \nFigure 1 : Surface (l) & Subsurface (r) Soil Moisture \n \n \n  \nThis lack of precipitation will affect the planting of the main crop, since inadequate soil moisture conditions exist across much of the country \n(optimum: 20 mm). Subsurface soil moisture conditions are also suboptimal and will not support the full development of the wheat and barley winter \ncrops (Deutsche Welthungerhilfe). \n \nAccording to FAO, winter and spring-planted crops are important for the food security in DPRK, although they account \nfor only 8 percent of total annual cereal production in DPRK. The winter and spring-planted crops backup the food \nsupplies until September, when the main season harvesting begins. Thus, the winter and spring harvest is crucial in the \nlean season summer months. If the early season crop production would suffer, the food insecurity situation in DPRK will \nbe further aggravated.  \n \nAny threat to food security will have a serious effect on an already stressed population in terms of food availability and \nthe risk of increased malnutrition which will affect the most vulnerable of the affected population \u2013 children, pregnant \nand lactating women, the elderly, and those with underlying illness. \n \nWhile the reduction in food production in 2018, as seen below, may not look too severe in comparison to previous years, \nit is important to remember that DPRK is already suffering from a protracted food crisis, making the population vulnerable \nto any further loss of harvest and food. Food production in 2018 in DPRK was 4 951 025 tons, which was the lowest \nover the past decade. It was 9.22 percent less than in 2017 and 10.66 percent less than the previous six-year average \n(2012-2017). According to FAO, the sharp decline of production was due to a decrease in total cropped area as well as \nyields. The yields suffered badly during the disasters in DPRK in 2018: heatwave, floods, and landslides. \n \n \nFigure 2: DPR Korea Crop Production (2009 \u2013 2018) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nP a g e  | 3 \n \nSummary of the current response \n \nOverview of Host National Society \nThe current priorities of the DPRK RCS are centered at first conducting a detailed assessment in coordination with IFRC \nCO to verify the result of the initial assessment and recommend further actions. The assessment will be conducted 6 \u2013 \n9 May 2019.  \n \nBased on available information, it is clear that the need for irrigation support is urgent, especially to protect subsistence \ncrop. The National Society is therefore planning to deploy mobile water pumps for irrigation in the most affected \ncommunities. This was also successfully tried out for the first time during the heatwave in 2018. \n \nThe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea Red Cross Society (DPRK RCS) is meeting with government agencies, \nsuch as the State Committee for Disaster and Emergency Management (SCDEM) to coordinate activities and better \nunderstand the needs and gaps. \n \nIn terms of livelihoods and food security, IFRC and DPRK RCS do implement some annual activities through the \nIntegrated Community Resilience Program (ICRP). Such activities primarily include provision of vegetable greenhouses, \nmushroom production facilities, and relevant trainings. Additionally, through an EU/DevCO funded pilot project, led by \nthe Swedish Red Cross, an exchange program is held between DPRK agricultural experts from Academy of Agricultural \nScience, State Academy of Science, and Ministry of Environment and Land Protection, as well as four target \ncommunities, and agricultural experts at the Research Institutes of Sweden. DPRK RCS is present throughout the \ncountry but primarily implements its ICRP in the provinces of North Hamgyong, South Hamgyong, North Phyongan, and \nSouth Phyongan. Activities through the ICRP may also start in North Hwanghae in 2019. \n \nOverview of Red Cross Red Crescent Movement in country \nThe IFRC has a country office in DPRK for over twenty years and currently has five delegates in-country comprising of \nthe Head of Country Office, National Society Development/Programme Coordination, Health/WASH, Finance, and \nDisaster Risk Management Delegate. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) also has an office in DPRK \nand there is close collaboration between IFRC and ICRC.  \n \nIFRC was, together with ICRC and the UN, called to a meeting with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of DPRK on the 14 \nFebruary 2019. In the meeting, the government briefed the delegation on the food production in 2018. According to the \ngovernment, it was the worst harvest in over a decade, and this was primarily due to the many disasters in 2018. In the \nmeeting, the government requested support from the international organizations to address the situation. \n \nIFRC has monitored the food shortage situation throughout the winter and spring. As it became increasingly clear that \nthe precipitation during winter and spring was far from enough for the coming spring and summer harvest, the efforts by \nIFRC have increased. The IFRC Country Office has closely coordinated with IFRC Asia Pacific Regional Office and \nhave received advise from the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre. RCRC Movement partners have also been \nbriefed regularly.  \n \nIFRC has and is continuously coordinating its assessments and plans with other international organisations in DPRK, \nincluding some of the NGOs and WFP. This coordination is done primarily through the Food Security and Agriculture \nSector Working Group, the Interagency Meetings, and through bilateral contacts. Coordination is done to share \ninformation and to avoid duplication of activities. \n \nOverview of non-RCRC actors in country \nThe main government actor is the State Committee for Emergency Disaster Management (SCEDM), with whom DPRK \nRCS is coordinating with. The most important UN actor in this response is the WFP and FAO, and IFRC maintains \nregular communication with them, as well as with other relevant international organizations in DPRK. A WFP/FAO \nassessment report on the food shortage is planned to be published early May and once that is done it may become \nclearer if WFP and others will plan any additional activities. Most discussions in terms of response so far have been \naround reducing the food shortage through food assistance, while IFRC is the only organization planning irrigation \nactivities to reduce the negative impact the low soil moisture levels will have on the highly important spring harvest.  \n \nThe government requested assistance by the international organizations on the 14 of February to address the food \nshortage. The government will also take the following measures1: \n \n1. Import food of 200,000 MT \n2. Concentration on farming of early crop to produce 400,000 MT \n                                                     \n \n1 Based on information provided by DPRK Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 14 February 2019. \nP a g e  | 4 \n \n3. As an emergency measure, the government will distribute 300 g of food per person per day, which is less than \nthe level set by the government of 550 g per person per day. In July they will increase 10 g so the ration will \nbe 310 g/day. \n \nNeeds analysis, targeting, scenario planning and risk assessment \n \nNeeds Analysis \nThe agricultural production this year in DPRK is seriously affected by the aftereffect of the droughts occurred \nconsecutively in the past 5 years. To make the situation worse, there was little snow fall last winter and almost no rainfall \nin the 1st quarter of this year. As a result, the water levels in the reservoirs is much lower than the standard. As winter \nand spring crops are important in the daily intake of the people in DPRK until September when the main season \nharvesting begins, there is an urgent need to ensure the productivity of the winter and spring crops. There is also an \nurgent need to ensure the survivability of the main crops to be sowed as the humidity of soil is very low in most of the \ncountry and there is not enough water for irrigation thus contributing to averting a bigger crisis. \n \nChronic food insecurity, early childhood malnutrition and nutrition insecurity are widespread in DPRK. According to the \n2018 Global Hunger Index (GHI), which measures and tracks hunger worldwide, DPRK ranks 109 out of 119 qualifying \ncountries. With a score of 34.0, DPRK suffers from a level of hunger that is \u2018serious\u2019.2 Around 10.9 million people, or 43 \nper cent of the total population, are food insecure.3 There are many complex and intertwined reasons for the high rates \nof food insecurity in DPRK. This includes mountainous terrain, with only 17 per cent of land good for cultivation. Farming \nis largely reliant on traditional farming methods, and a lack of agricultural inputs, such as quality seeds, proper fertilizer \nand equipment. In addition, changing weather patterns have left DPRK vulnerable to droughts and floods, which often \nresult in reductions in agricultural production. \n \nIFRC is the only organization planning irrigation activities to reduce the negative impact the low soil moisture levels will \nhave on the highly important spring harvest. While the spring harvest only pose for 8 per cent of the annual harvest, it \nis very important for people\u2019s food intake during the lean season. If the spring harvest would suffer significant damage, \nthe humanitarian situation will likely to deteriorate significantly. This would be at a time when the country is currently \nsuffering from the worst food shortage in over a decade. Protecting the spring harvest may therefore have a life-saving \nimpact and contribute to averting a bigger crisis. \n \nThe total number of affected people, 331,967, is based on the entire population in the two most vulnerable provinces. \nThis figure may be revised once the detailed assessment is done and more information is available. \n \nTargeting \nBased on available information, the DPRK RCS has conducted an initial assessment on 25 and 26 April through its \ncounty branches in South Hamgyong province. Through the initial assessment, three communities were identified as \nthe most vulnerable. These three communities are in two different counties, Jongpyong county and Hongwon county, \nSouth Hamgyong Province. These two counties are in the northern, mountainous, parts of South Hamgyong province. \nWhile the North Hamgyong province generally is considered to be the most vulnerable, the northern parts of South \nHamgyong are considered to also be particularly vulnerable. The two targeted counties in particular have sand soil which \nrequires more frequent irrigation, while North Hamgyong often has a different type of soil, less vulnerable to drought. \nThe two targeted counties also have their fields in an elevated area, compared to the more southern parts of the province, \nwhich makes irrigation more difficult. In the flatlands it is easier to use channels for irrigation. The criteria for targeting \nthus includes soil condition, elevation of the field, more prone to natural disasters than other communities, operational \ncapacity, and availability of water sources (other areas have a better access to rivers, but the targeted communities do \nnot). Additionally, DPRK RCS has a good volunteer network and program infrastructure established in the area, which \nwill allow quick and efficient start of activities. \n \nThe provincial branches have identified the three 3 most vulnerable communities, Ryulsong-ri, Jongpyong county, and \nUnha-ri and Unpo-ri, Hongwon county, in South Hamgyong province. Through this operation, the plan is to reach 5,831 \nhouseholds (22,129 people). \n \nOperation Risk Assessment \nThere is a risk that the drought conditions will continue in the coming months and that the situation will get worse. DPRK \nRCS has a limited capacity to increase its irrigation activities without a procurement process of more mobile water pumps, \nwhich may take time. Such procurement processed could take time due to the necessary approvals for exemptions by \nthe 1718 Sanctions Committee. The assessment will provide more information of the situation and the soil conditions \nand weather will be carefully monitored in the coming months. \n \n \n                                                     \n \n2 Global Hunger Index 2018: https://www.globalhungerindex.org/north-korea.html \n3 DPR Korea Needs and Priorities 2019 \nP a g e  | 5 \n \nB. Operational strategy \n \nProposed strategy \n \nThe DPRK RCS, in close coordination with IFRC, will conduct a detailed assessment 6 \u2013 9 of May on the current situation \nand decide response actions based on the needs identified. The main activity currently being planned is the deployment \nof mobile water pumps and fuel for pumping up water to fields to protect livelihoods of 5,831 households. The DPRK \nRCS will mobilize field-based volunteers and community people to the response actions. \n \nThe lessons learned workshop after the heatwave DREF operation in 2018 showed that the operation started a bit late \nand that it would have been more successful if it would have started earlier. Based on that lesson, IFRC DPRK CO and \nDPRK RCS deems it necessary to start irrigation activities as soon possible to protect the spring harvest. Volunteers \nand community members also expressed in the lessons learned workshop that the first training on operating the mobile \nwater pumps was insufficient. Last year the trainings on how to operate these were conducted in two phases, but people \nexpressed that they would have needed the information from the second training already from the start. DPRK RCS will \ntherefore conduct one, more in depth, training instead of two. Additional support and guidance for operating the mobile \nwater pumps throughout the operation can also be provided through DPRK RCS as needed. \n \nThe deployment of mobile water pumps will at first utilize existing water sources and based on assessment findings, \ndevelop new water sources as required. That could include digging ditches and wells. Such activities are coordinated \nwith the DPRK RCS WASH department. \n \nThe DREF operation is planned for three months and covers the following proposed activities: \n\u2022 \nDetailed assessment \n\u2022 \nDeployment and operation of 15 mobile water pumps \n\u2022 \nProcurement of relevant items for proper maintenance of mobile water pumps \n\u2022 \nTraining volunteers and community people on the usage and maintenance of mobile water pumps \n\u2022 \nProcurement of spare tires for vehicles used for transportation of mobile water pumps \n\u2022 \nMobilization of DPRK RCS staff, PDRT members, volunteers including insurance, and per diem \n\u2022 \nIFRC operational support including logistics, procurement, detailed assessment, monitoring and reporting \n\u2022 \nAdditional activities, including WASH and Health, will be considered and planned based on the assessment \nfindings \n\u2022 \nDistribution of family tents for cover for the farmers and RC volunteers operating the mobile water pumps \n\u2022 \nDeployment and maintenance of water onion tanks \n\u2022 \nLessons learned workshop \n \nOperational support services \n \nHuman resources \nThe director of the Disaster Management Department of DPRK RCS has overall operational responsibility and reports \nto the Secretary General. To support DPRK RCS with this operation, the IFRC CO will ensure that the funding and the \noperations are well coordinated. \n \nLogistics and Supply Chain \nLogistics activities aim to effectively manage the supply chain, including procurement, fleet, storage and transport to \ndistribution sites in accordance with the operation\u2019s requirement and aligned to IFRC\u2019s logistics standards, processes \nand procedures. \n \nThe Logistics Department of the DPRK RCS, with the support of IFRC DPRK CO logistics and in coordination with \nIFRC DRM Delegate, will facilitate the in-country transportation of available resources. The IFRC DPRK CO, in \ncoordination with DPRK RCS, will conduct local procurement of spare parts and oil for the mobile water pumps and if \nnecessary, some items will be procured internationally. The IFRC will consult the DPRK RCS regarding technical \nspecifications of necessary items. \n \nThe IFRC Asia Pacific Operational Logistics, Procurement and Supply Chain Management (OLPSCM) Department in \nKuala Lumpur will provide technical support to DPRK RCS and IFRC CO, as needed. \n \nSecurity \nThe IFRC DPRK Country Office has a standard country security plan in place, including contingency plans for Medevac, \nRelocation and Critical Incident Management. International delegates and local staff are familiar with the security \nprocedures and contingency plans, which were revised and updated in March/April 2019. The DPRK RCS has easy \naccess to the affected areas and enjoy excellent levels of cooperation with the government. Standard security measures \nsuch as fire extinguishers, fire management and evacuation plans are maintained in DPRK RCS warehouses. \nP a g e  | 6 \n \nPlanning, monitoring, evaluation, and reporting (PMER) \nBoth the DPRK RCS and the IFRC DPRK Country Office have well-functioning PMER processes to support the \nimplementation of this DREF. At least one update will be issued during the operation timeframe and a final report within \nthree months of the end of the operation. \n \nThe DPRK RCS and IFRC DM team will conduct monitoring visits to the affected areas throughout the operation. A \nlessons-learned workshop on the response will be conducted at the end of the operation. \n \nThe DPRK RCS keeps a gender and diversity balance in Human Resources (Red Cross staff and volunteers), making \nit easier to approach both male and female community members. This also makes it easier to ensure Community \nEngagement and Accountability in the operation. The DPRK RCS further applies a systematic approach from branches \nto HQs regarding reporting system, while Red Cross volunteers are delivering information about feedback and \ncomments from community people to branches via volunteer leaders. The DPRK RCS staff and IFRC delegates have \ngood access to the communities to obtain feedback through household visits for cross-checks which can be included in \nthe revised operation plan and implementation. \n \nAdministration and Finance \nThe IFRC CO Finance and Admin (FAD) unit will oversee procurement, quality control of materials and equipment to be \nprocured, and all financial matters and reports. The FAD unit, in coordination with IFRC Asia Pacific regional finance \nand logistics units, will extend support and guidance to the DPRK RCS logistics department in the procurement, as per \nthe IFRC procurement standards. \n \n \nC.

Situation Analysis \nDescription of the Disaster \n \nA long continuous drought combined with \nheavy rainfall attributed to the El Ni\u00f1o \nphenomenon and climate change over the past \ntwo years brought difficult times for Cuba. In \nrecent years, rainfall patterns during both the \ndry and rainy seasons have not reached normal \nhistorical values, which has caused a decrease \nin groundwater resources and the drying up of \nthe rivers and dams on which the population \ndepends on for its water supply.  \n \nCuba is now suffering from the effects of \nclimate change, especially temperature rise \nand a severe drought, which is considered the \nworst in the last 115 years. Decreased \naccumulated rainfall for more than 12 months \ncaused the country\u2019s dams to drop 38 per cent \nbelow their capacity; in addition, 98 water \nreservoirs were below 25 per cent and 26 were \ncompletely dry at the time of the writing of this \nreport.  \n \nDREF Final Report  \nCuba: Drought \nCuban Red Cross distribution water tanks.

The driest \ngroundwater basins were in the Eastern region of the country, especially in the Santiago de Cuba province, which has \na population of 1,057,404 inhabitants: 71 per cent in urban areas and 29 per cent in rural areas. With less than 30 per \ncent of water capacity in reservoirs and rainfall dropping below historical averages, this region was facing one of the \nmost severe droughts in the country\u2019s history.  \n \nThe province of Santiago de Cuba has nine municipalities, four of which were the most affected by the drought: Santiago \nde Cuba, Palma Soriano, III Frente and Guam\u00e1; the drought affected approximately 520,560 people (94,000 families), \nand urban areas were the most seriously affected. \n \nMay is considered the rainiest month in Cuba (onset of the rainy season); however, rainfall has decreased significantly \ndue to climate variability, particularly in Santiago de Cuba. The beginning of the rainy season (from May to October) \nwas affected by the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event, which has persisted in the equatorial Pacific Ocean \nsince early 2015, reaching its peak in November of the same year. Currently, most models forecast a transition to a \nneutral condition during spring in the Northern Hemisphere and show the likelihood of La Ni\u00f1a re-emerging during the \nsummer.  \nUsually when a strong El Ni\u00f1o event decreases in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean, rainfall during the onset of the \nrainy season tends to drop below average, particularly between May and June; nonetheless, it is important to note that \nnot all El Ni\u00f1o events behave similarly due to the changing patterns of ocean-atmospheric circulation. \n \nThe Cuban government has been supplying drinking water through water trucks; however, the long drought has \nexceeded their capacity and therefore a relief intervention is needed. In this regard, the government set up a water \ndistribution system based on water cycles, which consisted of supplying water during a 24-hour period to specific areas \nand then suspending the service for several days, which affected water storage at the household level. For this reason, \ngovernment authorities and the Cuban Red Cross identified a great need in the communities for water containers to \nincrease water storage capacity in households and meet the affected families\u2019 needs. The provision of 1,500-litre water \ntanks to health centres with the aim of increasing their water storage capacity was also been identified as a priority; \nother actions included the provision of 200-litre tanks and 10-litre buckets for the storage of drinking water in households.  \n \n \nThe IFRC, on behalf of the Cuban Red Cross would like to extend many thanks to all partners and donors for their \ngenerous contributions.  \n \nThe balance of this operation (20,751 CHF) will be reimbursed to the DREF. \n    \n \nSummary of current response \n \nOverview of Host National Society \n \nIn the area of intervention (at the provincial level), the Cuban Red Cross (CRC) consists of one provincial headquarters \n(in the city of Santiago) and nine municipal branches with a staff of 32 people; it is equipped with one 5-ton truck, two \n4-wheel drive vehicles and one motorcycle. In terms of storage, the CRC has access to government warehouses (in the \nprovince of Santiago, in case of an emergency), which are free of charge and offer security. \n \nAs of December 2015, the province had 4,087 active volunteers trained to carry out activities in first aid, operations and \nrelief, restoration of family links, youth, psychological support and water and sanitation. \n \nThe CRC branch in Santiago has been actively participating in the planning and implementation of several community-\nbased projects called PRECOS (Preparing Communities), which have been funded by the Norwegian Red Cross. The \nprovincial branch was also actively involved during the hurricane Sandy response in 2012. With funding from the \nNorwegian Red Cross, European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO) and the IFRC, this branch \nhas also conducted humanitarian aid distribution and shelter activities, as well as training in participatory methodologies \nsuch as safe shelters and water and sanitation. \n \nThe CRC in Santiago coordinated and worked on preparedness and response activities for droughts and earthquakes \nwith Civil Defence and the fire department.  \n \nOverview of distribution \nCommunities \nGender \nNo.  \nof People \nBenef. \nFamilies \nMinors \nElderly \n \n \nPersons \nwith  \ndisabilities \n250-\nlitre \ntanks \n10-litre \nbuckets \nMosquito \nnets \nM \nF \n15 \nYears \n60 \nYears \nP a g e  | 3 \n \nand \nunder \nand \nover \nHaydee Sta.

Source: Fidel Pe\u00f1a (NRC) \n \nOverview of Red Cross Red Crescent Movement in country \n \nThe IFRC and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) carry out activities with the CRC on a regular \nbasis; however, neither of them has a physical presence in the country; the collaboration between these organizations \nnormally involves specific activities such as the development and funding of the ICRC\u2019s Health Emergencies in Large \nPopulations (HELP) course. \n \nThe Norwegian Red Cross (NRC) has been present in Cuba since 2008, offering funding and technical support to the \nCRC on the PRECO project, which is currently in its fifth stage. During this time, there has been a permanent NRC in-\ncountry delegate; the NRC is therefore the only National Society physically present in Cuba. \n \n                                                     \n \n1 Note: Tanks: 3 damaged \n; 10-litre buckets: 60 broken; long-lasting insecticide treated [Mosquito] nets (LLITNs): 30 missing. \nP a g e  | 4 \n \nThe NRC delegate worked closely with the IFRC during this Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF), conducting the \ninitial technical assessment in the impact area, holding follow-up meetings at the CRC\u2019s national headquarters and at \nthe CRC branch in Santiago de Cuba, supporting supply processes with international providers, supervising \ndistributions in the field and running a workshop on lessons learned. It should be noted that a joint decision was made \nregarding the NRC\u2019s support to the emergency, which consisted of the purchase of 3,000 250-litre tanks to be \ndistributed among the same beneficiary families selected by this DREF.  \n \nOverview of other actors in country  \n \nIn the Santiago province, Civil Defence played a key role in the conducted actions, and it took the drought threat very \nseriously.  \n \nGovernment authorities set up an emergency work group in mid-2014 to address the drought issue in the Santiago \nprovince. To date, they are still holding coordination meetings with different government bodies to assess the activities \nthat are being carried out; the meetings take place every Saturday to discuss unresolved problems and make the \nappropriate decisions on how to support better the drought-affected population. In addition, the government provided \nwater trucks to the affected communities.  \n \nThe government also held meetings with the National Society to coordinate actions that require permits from the Cuban \ngovernment, such as the coordination with the Department of Health Education and the Ministry of Public Health; the \naim was to produce prevention materials and disseminate information on protection and self-care. These meetings also \nestablished reporting mechanisms and weekly coordination meetings with Civil Defence and other government bodies \ninvolved in decision making. In addition, the government authorized the National Society to import water tanks. \n \nIn terms of the population, the information flow with community representatives was effective since most community \nmembers were aware of the issue and the proposed mitigation actions. Despite the difficult situation, the beneficiaries \ndid not express dissatisfaction during the visits.  \n \nNeeds analysis and scenario planning \n \nNeeds were identified during the initial and detailed assessments of the emergency, and they remained relatively \nconsistent with the drought situation in the country. \n \nAugust 2016 was the month with the lowest rainfall during the rainy season due to the effects of the South Atlantic \nHigh; however, rains and electrical storms associated with the effects of tropical systems occurred at the end of the \nmonth. August also marked the start of cyclonic activity in Cuba, and hurricane season lasted until October 2016, when \nHurricane Matthew\u2019s passage over Cuba caused an accumulation of rainfall in the country\u2019s eastern area.  \n \nRisk Analysis \n \nIn general, humanitarian interventions in Cuba do not imply a serious security risk; however, due to the topography of \nthe country, some places cannot be accessed by motor vehicles. The CRC has a protection protocol in place for their \nvolunteers during aid distributions, which is implemented in coordination with other actors.  \n \nB. Operational strategy and plan \n \nOverall objective \n \nTo provide humanitarian assistance through water and sanitation activities to 2,000 families (10,000 people) who were \naffected by the prolonged drought in the province of Santiago and increase their resilience.  \n \nOperational Strategy  \n \nWater and sanitation:  \n \nThe areas of opportunity for the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement (RCRC) are shown in the table below as per the \ninformation provided by Cuban authorities (at the provincial and national levels) and by local communities. The main \nneed was to increase the water storage capacity of households due to the water cycles established through the water \nsupply system in the city of Santiago; other needs were related to the Ministry of Public Health\u2019s (MINSAP for its \nacronym in Spanish) provision of institutional support, which had the roles of establishing a quality surveillance system \nthrough water sampling at different points of the drinking water supply network and measuring residual chlorine levels \nto reduce any risk to the population, even though water was not being supplied on a continual basis.   \n \nP a g e  | 5 \n \nSpecific activity in area \nof opportunity \nWhy intervention was \nrequired \nHow the action was \nimplemented \nImplications potential \nrisks identified \nProvision of 250-litre tanks \nto the general population \nTo increase water storage \ncapacity at the household level, \ngiven the 10 to 20-day delivery \ncycles \nStrict selection of potential \nbeneficiaries according to \nvulnerability criteria and with \nlocal authorities\u2019 active \nparticipation. \nThese types of tanks are produced \nin Cuba, but there were limited \nquantities of them, access to raw \nmaterials, and prior industrial \ncommitments \nProvision of 1,000-litre \ntanks to MINSAP facilities \nTo increase water storage \ncapacity in health institutions, \nprioritizing clinics and hospitals \nthat perform major surgeries \nSame as above \nSame as above \nProvision of impregnated \nmosquito nets for the \ngeneral population \nTo provide extra protection against \nmosquitoes at the household level \nSame as above active \nparticipation by local authorities. \nLLITNs had to be imported from \nabroad, according to Cuban \nCustoms procedures. \nProvision of portable kits \nto detect total chlorine and \nfree residual chlorine, and \nDPD1 and DPD3 tablets \nTo increase MINSAP technicians' \ncapacity to sustain activities to \nmonitor the quality of water \nprovided by INRH. \n \nProvide equipment and \nadditional training to MINSAP \ntechnicians on their use \nThis equipment and tablets had to \nbe purchased and imported from \nabroad, according to Cuban \nCustoms procedures \nProvision of chlorine \ntablets (for 10 litres of \nwater) to the population in \ngeneral \nTo ensure water treatment at the \nhousehold level in Santiago \nProvide tablets to families \nreceiving 200-litre tanks, using \nthe same criteria indicated \nThis equipment and tablets had to \nbe purchased and imported from \nabroad, according to Cuban \nCustoms procedures \nProvision of buckets (10- \nto 20-litres) to the general \npopulation \nTo ensure that the population has \na means of storage with a lid \nexclusively for drinking water \nProvide storage for safe water to \nfamilies using the same criteria \nindicated \nThese buckets had to be \npurchased and imported from \nabroad, according to Cuban \nCustoms procedures \nTrash bags for the \npopulation in general and \nhealth facilities \nTo enable the population to \nproperly dispose of solid waste \nand prevent the spread of vector-\nborne diseases \nProvide bags to families \nreceiving 200-litre tanks, using \nthe same criteria indicated \nThese bags had to purchased and \nimported from abroad, according \nto Cuban Customs procedures \n  \nThis list was analyzed while considering the following:  \n\uf0b7 \nAvailability of financial resources from Movement\u2019s actors.  \n\uf0b7 \nAvailability of the required products in the country and the possibility of local purchase \n\uf0b7 \nCompliance with the Cuban government\u2019s law on purchasing of products abroad and imported goods.  \nThe government did not declare a state of emergency during the drought, which impacted the importation of \nsome relief items.   \n \nOperational Support Services \n \nHuman Resources  \n \nThe relief items for the affected households were distributed by volunteers from the CRC Santiago branch and its \nmunicipal branches, who already had prior experience in conducting such activities. The monitoring was carried out by \nCRC headquarters\u2019 staff with the support of the NRC delegate, who also supported the implementation of the activities.  \n \nThe IFRC supported the operation with a disaster management coordinator from the Disaster and Crisis Department \n(DC), who provided technical support to the operation. \n \nLastly, the CRC provided its volunteers with visibility equipment to carry out the community activities.  \n \nLogistics and supply chain \n \nThe humanitarian aid and supplies delivered during the operation were purchased by the IFRC\u2019s regional office for the \nAmericas through the Logistics Unit in accordance with the rules stated in the Sphere and IFRC manual and according \nto the National Society\u2019s rules. \n \nThe DREF\u2019s funding covered the fuel and maintenance costs for the vehicles used during the operation.   \n \nItems were sent to Cuba by sea and air to their specific destination. Import permits were processed through the Cuban \ngovernment, with support from the CRC.  \n \nThere were some changes to the location where the 250-litre tanks with lids and 6,000 plastic buckets with lids were \nfinally received; these items were supposed to arrive in La Habana, but since the government was supplying storage \nand transport, it was requested that the items be received and stored in Santiago de Cuba in available storage facilities.  \n \nP a g e  | 6 \n \nC.

The NRC completely financed this \npurchase and it was independent of the DREF. Through the NRC\u2019s support, 2,997 250-litre tanks were distributed \nto 2,997 families in the communities of Abel Santamar\u00eda, Haydee Santamar\u00eda, Micro 8 and Altamira, including 50 \nfamilies that were declared by the Social Security department to be \u201cvery vulnerable people\u201d (elderly living alone, \nP a g e  | 7 \n \npersons with disabilities, single mothers with children, children with chronic diseases, etc.). Due to transport and \nhandling issues, three 250-litre tanks were damaged and could not be delivered to three families.  \n \nDistribution of 1,000-litres tanks to MINSAP (Ministry of Public Health) facilities \nThis activity was not carried out because it was not included in the initial budget and the costs exceeded the \navailable funds.  \n \nPurchase of 4,000 Long Lasting Insecticide-Treated Nets (LLITN) (2 per family) \nIn addition to the distribution of supplies to the selected communities (see distribution table under the Summary of \ncurrent response section) and due to the current epidemiological situation, the local government in Santiago de \nCuba requested the CRC to distribute 1,000 mosquito nets in 3 field hospitals where dengue and Zika patients \nwere being treated and the other 3,000 LLITNs in the affected communities. During the customs process the \nshipment was held up by customs officials for several weeks, which resulted in 30 mosquito nets missing from the \ncargo.  \n \nPrinting of educational material \nThe 3,000 initial surveys carried out revealed that:  \n\uf0d8 Some people know how water should be treated, but they don\u2019t take any measures in this regard  \n\uf0d8 People know the community factors involved in community talks  \n\uf0d8 Some people use too much chlorine when treating water  \n\uf0d8 The National Society conducted a hygiene promotion workshop for volunteers in Santiago de Cuba \n \nA strategy to promote knowledge on Safe Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion was implemented in \ncollaboration with the MINSAP National and Provincial Health Promotion Department in Santiago de Cuba; this \nresulted in the design and printing of educational materials for hygiene promotion aimed at Cuban families, which \ncontributed to the dissemination of the necessary knowledge and skills for risk reduction and management.   \n \nThe educational material was distributed in the selected communities, as well as to the Provincial Centre for Health \nEducation and Promotion, the Provincial Centre for Disaster Risk Reduction, the Water Institute, and nine CRC \nbranches; it was well received by both community members and organizations due to the high quality of its content \nand design.  \n \nPurchase of 500,000 plastic 10-litre trash bags  \n \nThe Provincial Health Department supported the distribution of water and sanitation supplies to ensure better \noperational capacity and control the spread of communicable diseases in Santiago de Cuba.  \nResources included: \n\uf0d8 350 chlorine measuring kits  \n\uf0d8 5,000,000 aquatab tablets \n\uf0d8 70,000 DPD3 and DPD1 tablets \n\uf0d8 500,000 trash bags \n \nThis contributed to an improvement in local capacity in the daily monitoring of the amount of total chlorine and free \nresidual chlorine in the drinking water network and at the household level using the \u201cchlorine kit\u201d portable \nequipment; it also provided the ability to issue necessary warnings when appropriate. \n \nAdditionally, Public Health Centres were provided with chorine tablets to ensure the supply of drinking water and \ntrash bags to ensure the appropriate disposal of solid waste and prevent the spread of vector-borne diseases.  \n \nThese resources were distributed in 9 municipalities of the Santiago de Cuba province in the following health \nfacilities:  \n\uf0fc Hygiene and Epidemiology Provincial Centre  \n\uf0fc North and South Children Hospital,  \n\uf0fc North, East and South Maternity Hospital, Palma Soriano  \n\uf0fc Oncological Hospital \n\uf0fc Juan Bruno Zayas Clinical Surgical Hospital \n\uf0fc Saturnino Lora Provincial Hospital  \n\uf0fc Ambrosio Grillo Hospital  \n\uf0fc Military Hospital  \n\uf0fc Jagua Psychiatric Hospital  \n\uf0fc Contramaestre, Palma Soriano, II Frente, Mella, Songo la Maya, Guama and III Frente Hospitals \n \nSetting-up of community monitoring committees  \nP a g e  | 8 \n \nCommunity monitoring committees were set up in the communities of Abel Santamar\u00eda, Haydee Santamar\u00eda, Micro \n8 and Altamira, where the operation was implemented.

These efforts enabled \nthe communities to organize themselves to ensure the safekeeping, adjusting and checking of the supplies during the \ndelivery and support the delivery and training processes. Additionally, two accountability reports were issued \nregarding the compliance of the programme\u2019s timeline and indicators, ensuring that the operation\u2019s actions and \nchanges were carried out in a participatory and transparent way.  \n \nMonitoring visits by the CRC headquarters  \nThe CRC headquarters made four monitoring and control visits to perform the necessary adjustments, facilitate \npurchase processes and organize operational workshops.  \n \nProgress reports on affected communities and reporting of activities \nThree follow-up reports on the progress of communities were presented to share information, make the necessary \nadjustments, assess the compliance of planned indicators, as well as to make changes to planned activities and the \ncurrent budget. An extension of the programme timeframe was requested.  \n \nReporting of activities \nTwo Operations Update reports were issued during the operation; Operations Update No.1 was issued on 26 August \n2016 and Operations Update No. 2 was issued on 2 December 2016.  \n \nBeneficiary satisfaction surveys  \nP a g e  | 9 \n \n \n \n \n \nContact Information \n \nFor further information specifically related to this operation please contact: \n \nIn the Cuban Red Cross: \n\uf0b7 \n Dr. Luis Foyo Ceballos, General Director, Cuban Red Cross; email: crsn@infomed.sld.cu  \n \nIn the IFRC Regional Representation: \n\uf0b7 \nSantiago Luengo, Acting Regional Disaster Management Coordinator for the Caribbean, phone: +521 \n3314664747; email: santiago.luengo@ifrc.org.  \n \nIn the Americas region: \n\uf0b7 \nCarlos I\u00f1igo Barrena, head of the Disaster and Crisis Department, phone: +507 6679 3238; email: \nci.barrena@ifrc.org;  \n\uf0b7 \nDiana Medina, Communications Unit manager for the Americas, phone: +507 317 3050; email: \ndiana.medina@ifrc.org  \n\uf0b7 \nStephany Murillo, Regional Logistics senior officer, phone: +507 317 3050; mobile: +507 6679-9674; email: \nstephany.murillo@ifrc.org  \n \nFor Resource Mobilization and Pledges: \n\uf0b7 \nJulie Hoare, Head of Partnership and Relationship Development (PRD), phone: +507 317 3050; email: \njulie.hoare@ifrc.org  \n \n For Performance and Accountability (planning, monitoring, evaluation and reporting enquiries) \n\uf0b7 \nPriscilla Gonzalez; planning, monitoring and reporting team coordinator; email: priscila.gonzalez@ifrc.org  \n \nIn Geneva: \n\uf0b7 \nCristina Estrada, response and recovery lead; +41 22 730 45 29; cristina.estrada@ifrc.org \n \n \nClick here to return to the title page. \n \n       \nHow we work \nAll IFRC assistance seeks to adhere to the Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent \nMovement and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO\u2019s) in Disaster Relief and the Humanitarian Charter and \nMinimum Standards in Disaster Response (Sphere) in delivering assistance to the most vulnerable. \nThe IFRC\u2019s vision is to inspire, encourage, facilitate and promote at all times all forms of humanitarian activities by \nA total of 2,890 surveys were conducted in the four communities where the training and distribution of resources took \nplace. These distributions had a great impact on beneficiary families, who were very satisfied with the resources \nreceived at no cost and were able to increase their water storage capacity. As a general outcome, many beneficiaries \nexpressed a behavioural change in their water treatment habits.   \n \nCommunity members expressed gratitude to the CRC and the donors for the aid provided.  \n \nEvaluations of lessons learned  \nThis activity was designed and carried out with the support of the NRC. The lessons learned report is available here.   \n \nDrafting of beneficiary stories  \nNo beneficiary stories were written because they were originally planned as part of the communications plan, which \nhad to be changed at the end of the operation. \n \nIFRC monitoring visits  \nThe IFRC made two monitoring visits to Cuba with the aim of bringing support to the operation, and it also provided \nremote support. During the implementation phase, the disaster coordinator for the Caribbean role WAS assumed by \na different IFRC staff member midway through the operation; however, this did not have an impact on the \ncommunication with the CRC and the follow-up of the activities planned for this DREF.  \nP a g e  | 10 \n \nNational Societies, with a view to preventing and alleviating human suffering, and thereby contributing to the \nmaintenance and promotion of human dignity and peace in the world. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe IFRC\u2019s work is guided by Strategy 2020 which puts forward three strategic aims: \n1.

Click here for the interim financial report> \n \nSummary:  \n \nAccording to the Food Security Outlook Update - August 2016 published by the Famine Early Warning Systems Network \n(FEWSNET), rainfall is expected to increase, resulting in near-average national harvests for the Primera and Postrera \nseasons. There are reports of localized damage to staple crops in low-lying areas of eastern and western parts of the \ndry corridor due to the erratic distribution of rainfall and cumulative rainfall deficits for the season; however, the damage \nis less severe than last year. \n \nThe poorest households in the Western Temperate Highlands remained in crisis mode (IPC Phase 3) until October \n2016, when income-generating opportunities improved seasonally; their status has since been upgraded to \u201cStressed\u201d \n(IPC Phase 2) as of January 2017 because they now have food reserves from their December 2016 harvests at their \ndisposal. \n \nEmergency Appeal Operations Update  \nGuatemala: Food Insecurity and Drought \n \nP a g e  | 2 \n \n \n \n  \nAccording to the Institute of Seismology, Volcanology, Meteorology and Hydrology of Guatemala (INSIVUMEH), the \nwinter of 2015 was severely affected by the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon; satellite estimates indicated that the accumulated \nrainfall was the lowest in the last 35 years, especially in the region known as the Dry Corridor. \n \nThe drought affected households in the western region by reducing the production of basic grains, income and access \nto employment. In the particular case of Guatemala, 2016 was the third consecutive year in which small farmers were \naffected by the scarcity of rain. According to the reports issued by Action Against Hunger, 50 per cent of the rural \npopulation exhausted their mechanisms of survival in 2016, and by the end of the year, the Ministry of Agriculture, \nLivestock and Food reported that there were more than 110,000 food insecure families due to the drought. \n \nIn January 2016, Guatemala Red Cross carried out a detailed evaluation of families in the rural areas of the Chich\u00e9 and \nPatzite municipalities in the department of Quich\u00e9, which determined that all of the interviewed families experienced \nlosses of more than 50 per cent; in addition, more than 35 per cent of families were implementing survival strategies \nthat included the sale of livestock and physical assets. \n  \nA.2 Summary of measures taken by the National Society \n \n \nUnder the operation\u2019s framework, the National Society established 8 criteria for the selection of families and \ncommunities: \n\u2022 Families whose livelihood is 60 per cent1 dependent on maize sowing \n\u2022 households with partial or total loss of crops (beans and maize) \n\u2022 households with single mothers that are heads of household, \n\u2022 households with more than 7 family members,  \n\u2022 households with elderly members, \n\u2022 households with children under 5 and / or pregnant women, \n\u2022 households with persons with disabilities, \n\u2022 families of children with acute malnutrition \n \nBased on these criteria, the following communities were prioritized: \n\u2022 Choyomche 1 \n\u2022 Choyomche 2 \n\u2022 Choyomche 3 \n                                                     \n \n1 This percentage was determined by the assessment.  \nP a g e  | 3 \n \n\u2022 Carrizal \n\u2022 San Francisco \n\u2022 Laguna Seca 1 \n\u2022 Chuicojonop \n\u2022 Pachaj \n\u2022 Pazajcap \n \nThe selection criteria were used to provide the following aid and services to the affected families:  \n \nAREA OF INTERVENTION \nCHICH\u00c9 \nPATZIT\u00c9 \nTOTAL \nFOOD SECURITY, NUTRITION AND LIVELIHOODS \nFood distribution \n681 families \n319 families \n1,000 families \nStrengthening of livelihoods  \n0 \n360 families \n360 families \nDiversification of livelihoods \n0 \n0 \n0 \nGrowth monitoring  \n0 \n0 \n0 \nNutritional screening \n288 children \n212 children \n500 children \nEducational sessions for mothers \n600 mothers \n0 \n600 mothers \nHome visits \n30 families \n20 families \n50 families \nWATER, SANITATION AND HYGIENE PROMOTION  \nInstallation of rainwater harvesting systems  \n70 families \n0 \n70 families \nProtection of water sources and maintenance of \nwater systems \n4 communities \n0 \n4 communities \nParticipatory \nHygiene \nand \nSanitation \nTransformation (PHAST) \n600 mothers \n0 \n600 mothers \nC.

The expanded operation will focus on the following \nsectors: health; water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH); livelihood, nutrition, food security. It also reflects a \nsubstantial increase in the target population, number of activities, an enlarged geographic scope and timeframe for \nimplementation. The current funding gap is 11,742,626 Swiss francs. This Appeal takes in to account the findings and \nrecommendations of the comprehensive meher (main crop season) assessment conducted by the Government of \nEthiopia (GoE) and its partners, including the ERCS, in November and December 2016. The planned response reflects \nthe current situation and information available at this time of the evolving operation, and will be adjusted based on further \ndevelopments and more detailed assessments.

According to the GoE, the positive impact of the 2016 summer kiremt/gu/ganna rains and the \nsubsequent above-average meher harvest rains in northern and western parts of the country significantly \nreduced the number of people requiring food assistance from 10.2 million in 2016 to 5.6 million in 2017. \nHowever, the impact of the Indian Ocean Dipole1 and the failure of the autumn deyr/hagaya rains have \nnegatively impacted the food security of pastoralist households in southern and south-eastern lowland areas \nand in pockets of areas throughout the country. The October to December rains started late and were infrequent \nespecially in the southern and south eastern parts of the country, resulting in rivers drying up in several areas \nincluding Somali, Oromia and SNNP regions. In these areas, the total cumulative rainfall was well below \naverage coupled with equally below average March to May 2016 rains thereby compounding the existing \ndrought situation. The consecutive poor rainfall seasons have resulted in poor water and pasture regeneration \nand dried out water sources. This has led to death of livestock, high levels of malnutrition and food insecurity.  \n \nThe ERCS and GoE counterparts from the department of agriculture, livestock and disaster preparedness at \nthe zone level carried out assessments in Moyale district in November 2016. The assessment findings reflected \nevidence of emaciated animals, drying up of water sources and increased malnutrition. Further assessments \nin SNNP and Oromia regions in January 2017 confirmed similar situations of abnormal livestock deaths, lack \nof water, drying up of even the most reliable rivers in the region, and lack of pasture. The findings of these \nassessments were key in prioritizing geographic as well as sectoral areas for intervention in the revised appeal.   \n \nIn Afar and northern parts of Somali region, however, near normal rains were experienced in November \nresulting in water and pasture regeneration and generally improved food security and nutrition. Coincidentally, \nthese good rainfall conditions are conducive for the ERCS planned livestock re- stocking programme that will \nbe carried out in March to May 2017.  \n \nIt is against this background that on 17 January 2017, the Government of Ethiopia launched the 2017 \nHumanitarian Requirements Document (HRD) seeking US$948 million to reach 5.6 million people with \nemergency food and non-food assistance.   \n \nNeeds assessment  \nA rapid assessment was conducted by the ERCS in Moyale district in Somali region in November 2016. This \nwas followed up by rapid assessments conducted in Kindo and Koysha districts of Oromia region and Male, \nBena, Tsemay and Hamer districts of Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People\u2019s Region (SNNPR) region in \nFebruary 2017.  \n \nAssessment findings conclude that Kindo and Koysha districts of Oromia region have been assessed and \nranked as priority 1 compared to priority 3 from the assessment conducted in November 2016. The findings \nhighlight needs in the following areas: \n \nWASH: In Moyale district, Muti Ambo, Dembi, Tuka, Argene, Medo, Bokola, Lega Sire, Bede and Tilo Kebeles2 \nhave been severely affected by drought. 35 out of 50 ponds have dried up, with the remaining 15 ponds having \na limited amount of water, which is contaminated by faeces. Some families reported travelling up to 30km for \ndrinking water, where 20 litres of water cost about 25 birr (1.12 Swiss francs). School attendance has reduced \nby about 50 per cent in some Kebeles due to the lack of water.   \n \nIn Kindo and Koysha districts, three major rivers and eight artificial ponds have dried up as well as individual \nfarmer water conservation ponds. Nine out of 13 Kebeles have no access to water at all; water is usually brought \nin from outside or livestock travels 35-40km in search of water in neighbouring districts. In Male, Bena, Tsemay \nand Hamer districts, there are some non-functioning shallow wells and deep wells. Zone administration is \ntrucking water with one truck assigned to each district. District offices are requesting additional trucks as the \nnumber of beneficiaries is increasing. \n \nFood security: In Moyale district, reduction in milk availability has impacted the nutritional status of the milk-\ndependent pastoralist children under five who are at high risk of malnutrition. In Kindo and Koysha district \n19,000 people registered with Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) and 5,100 people receiving basic \nfood rations. However, there is a shortage of water for cooking. GoE started school feeding programme in nine \nmost affected kebeles and all Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM) cases are receiving assistance from GoE. In \n                                                 \n1 http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/enso/history/ln-2010-12/IOD-what.shtml \n \n2 Kebeles is the smallest administration unit of Ethiopia. \nP a g e  | 3 \n \n \nMale district, the zone administration is distributing food under the PSNP for those registered as well as \nsupplementary food for lactating and pregnant women. \n \nLivelihoods:  In Moyale district, 80 per cent of pastoralists derive 70 per cent of their income from livestock \nsales and products. Shortage of pasture and water due to recurrent drought has adversely affected livestock \nproduction resulting in poor livestock body condition, death of new-borns and occurrence of livestock diseases. \nA total of 137 livestock have died and 71 cattle are diseased and there is a decline in livestock market prices.  \n \nIn Kindo and Koysha district natural pasture has dried up due to the drought.  A total of 139,368 cattle, 27,696 \ngoats and 9,213 sheep remain at risk of starvation. Cattle are visibly losing weight and are too weak to travel \nto find water and pasture. Children are reportedly dropping out of school to look for water for livestock. While   \nin Bena Tsemay and Hamer districts high death rates of cattle are reported. The cattle are prone to diseases \nlike bovine pastoralises due to low immunity they have as a result of the lack of fodder and water.  \n \nHealth: In Moyale district, the health centre has only one ambulance and limited emergency drugs available.  \nMalnutrition screening was carried out to identify Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) in October 2016 while \nmeasles screening is still ongoing. Overall health service delivery is not achieving its\u2019 targets, especially the \nexpanded programmes on immunisation, family planning, anti-natal care, post-natal care and child delivery. \n \nIn Kindo and Koysha districts 69 Health Extension Workers (HEWS) are active. As this area is endemic for \nmalaria, there is a need for awareness on the use of mosquito nets.  A small outbreak of Acute Watery Diarrhoea \n(AWD) was noted and controlled in February 2017. It was also noted there is a shortage of drugs for water-\nborne diseases in health centres. In Male, Bena, Tsemay and Hamer districts over 100 MAM cases have been \nreported. These districts also have high prevalence of malaria-prone, however the situation is being closely \nmonitored by the Government. \n \nSummary of response to date \nSince the launch of the Emergency Appeal in January 2016, the ERCS has been able to provide: \n \n\uf0b7 \nFood distribution for 724 Pregnant and Lactating Women (PLW) and 2,289 under five children (934 \nfemales and 1,355 male) in which a two-month food ration for all 15 wards was also distributed. \n\uf0b7 \nHygiene promotion and messages on how to cook the Coy Soya Beans (CSB) were carried at the \ndistribution sites during distribution and were also given to the beneficiaries and care takers with a \nreach of 876 households.  \n\uf0b7 \nHealth promotion and nutrition messages on exclusive breastfeeding were given during distributions in \naddition to 770 women reached by the Community Based Health Care and First Aid (CBHFA) \nvolunteers. \n\uf0b7 \nPost distribution household visits were carried out by volunteers and project staff for 4,447 households \nincluding home visits, school health and sanitation clubs in four schools to monitor and provide \nguidance on behavioral change activities. \n\uf0b7 \nCBHFA training provided for 75 volunteers including provision of tool kit for all 75 volunteers with one \nset planned per volunteer. \n\uf0b7 \nA WASH needs assessment was conducted for a sample of 282 households in Bidu in which the \nrespondents were mainly women. \n\uf0b7 \nThe ERCS volunteers conducted household awareness on hygiene and sanitation, AWD, identification \nand monitoring of SAM cases and linking with the health facility.  \n\uf0b7 \nIn addition, the ERCS has been responding with its own funds and through support from Movement \nand external partners since the early stages of the drought. Overall, ERCS has assisted 56,546 under \nfive children and PLW with supplementary feeding, worth 840,000 Swiss francs from ERCS\u2019s own \nnational and regional fundraising efforts. \n \nBeneficiary Selection \nInterventions will be aligned with the IFRC-minimum standard commitments to gender and diversity in \nemergency programming, for example the selection of beneficiaries was based on their level of vulnerability, \nincluding: households that have lost their source of livelihoods (loss of crops and animals), the chronically ill, \nelderly, female-headed households, lactating mothers and under-five children (malnourished), pregnant \nwomen, and/or people with disabilities. The ERCS has been working closely with the Government, stakeholders \nand other agencies to ensure that there will be no duplication of interventions of activities.  \n \nOverall objective \nThe revised Emergency Appeal will assist 318,325 beneficiaries through the distribution of supplementary food, \nsupport to malnutrition screening and referral, community health services support, improved access to safe \nwater and hygiene promotion, and reinforcing family livelihoods and coping mechanisms. The supplementary \nP a g e  | 4 \n \n \nfood component in the revised Appeal targets families with children under five and pregnant and lactating \nmothers. \n \nCoordination and partnerships \nThe ERCS technical coordinators based in the headquarters Disaster Preparedness and Response Department \nparticipate in their respective clusters to allow for enhanced visibility of Red Cross Movement activities and \nensure coordination with non-Movement partners. The ERCS is part of the Drought Technical Working Group \norganised by the National Disaster Response Mission Commission (NDRMC) in Addis Ababa. At zonal and \nworeda3 level, the GoE has organised Drought Response Task Forces in which the ERCS branches participate. \n \nThe IFRC supports the ERCS through its East Africa and Indian Ocean Islands (EAIOI) Country Cluster Support \nTeam (CCST) and the Regional Office for Africa, which are both based in Nairobi, Kenya, and through an IFRC \nOperations Manager based in the ERCS headquarters in Addis Ababa. \n \nIn Ethiopia, the IFRC, ICRC and Partner National Societies (PNSs) participate in regular co-ordination meetings \nconvened by the ERCS. All issues including potential bilateral and multilateral actions are discussed. \nAdditionally, IFRC convenes regular co-ordination meetings in Nairobi with ICRC and PNS representatives to \nshare updates on the situation in Ethiopia and neighbouring countries, and Movement actions to date.  \n \nThere is an extensive PNS presence in Ethiopia, and all PNS\u2019s have different strategies to support the ERCS \ndrought emergency response. Discussion with the IFRC Country representative and the ERCS Secretary \nGeneral resulted in an agreement that all partners\u2019 drought response activities should be harmonised with the \nERCS National Drought Response Plan.  \n \nThe overall emergency response in Ethiopia is led by the NDRMC in close coordination with the Disaster Risk \nManagement Food Security Services (DRMFSS) of the Ministry of Agriculture. Sector task forces have been \nestablished at national, regional, zonal and woreda level with the participation of all stakeholders including the \nERCS. \n \nTo date, the GoE has allocated more than US$ 730 million to address critical humanitarian needs.  National \nand sub-national committees have been established to oversee the distribution of relief supplies, which include \nfood distributions, water point rehabilitation, livestock support, health services, and non-food items distribution \nfor the internally displaced families.  \n \nThe GoE, together with partners, has been able to respond to most of the increased health related needs \nattributed to drought. To maximise the response capacity, the GoE had divided the most affected woredas in \neach region amongst operational partners. With ongoing drought affecting mostly the southern and south \neastern areas, partners need to re-look at scaling up their operational presence in these areas and programme \nfocus to include emergency activities alongside their current development programmes. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n3 Woredas is the Ethiopian term for districts \nP a g e  | 5 \n \n

The expanded operation \nwill focus on the following sectors: Health, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), Livelihoods, Nutrition and Food \nSecurity. It also reflects a substantial increase in the target population, number of activities, an enlarged geographic \nscope and timeframe for implementation. The current funding gap is 23,985,618 Swiss francs. The planned response \nreflects the current situation and information available now of the evolving operation, and will be adjusted based on \nfurther developments and more detailed assessments. Details are available in the Emergency Plan of Action (EPoA).   \n \nThe disaster and the Red Cross Red Crescent response to date \n \nMarch \u2013 May 2016: During the seasonal rains, heavy \nflooding of the River Tana washed away crops and delayed \nplanting amongst the communities living along the river in \nGarissa and Tana River, resulting in reduced household level \nfood security and dietary intake. On the other hand, parts of \narid and semi-arid (ASAL) counties started experiencing \nsome level of drought stress due to poor performance of the \nMarch-May 2016 long rainy season.  \n  \n           June 2016: The Government`s early warning system started     \nsignalling drought stress in pockets of the coastal region as \nearly as June. \n \nSeptember 2016: The early warning information covering the \nmonth of September indicated the most drought affected \ncounties as Kilifi, Kwale, Tana River and Taita Taveta. Others \nare Wajir, Mandera, Marsabit, Makueni, Kitui and Samburu. \nThe drought and food security situation in these counties ranges from moderate to severe. \n \n 23 November 2016: The KRCS through the IFRC launched an Emergency Appeal for 3,844,037 Swiss francs. \nA total of 297,808 Swiss francs was allocated from the IFRC\u2019s Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF). \n \n10 February 2017: The KRCS through the IFRC revised the Appeal to 9,107,628 Swiss francs to assist 340,786 \npeople in 13 counties. \n \nFebruary 2017: Kenya Food Security Steering Group conducted a short rains assessment. The findings indicated \nthe population requiring emergency and humanitarian assistance had increased to 2.7 million. The government \nfurther announced the increase of affected population to three million and projected to hit four million by mid- April.  \n \nEmergency Appeal Revision \nKenya: Drought \n \nKRCS volunteer assisting in food distribution.  \nPhoto: KRCS \nP a g e  | 2 \n \n25 March 2017: The KRCS through the IFRC revises the Appeal for 25,062,572 Swiss francs to assist 1,033,300 \npeople (150,424 households) in 14 counties. \n \nThe second revision of this appeal is brought on by a greater need for 1) Health and Nutrition 2) WASH and 3) Food \nSecurity and Livelihoods interventions in 14 counties, now including Laikipia county. On nutrition, there is a great \nincrease in the number of people who require support, especially in the number of children with acute malnutrition. Some \ncounties are reporting rates of acute malnutrition ranging between 15 per cent in Baringo to 32 per cent in Mandera \nbased on mixed criteria - MUAC and Weight for Height. Thus, KRCS is scaling up activities in health and nutrition, cash \ntransfer, animal destocking and slaughter programming, and distribution of foodstuffs. Furthermore, KRCS\u2019 assessments \nshow the distance to water points is much longer than average in recent months (impacting up to 70 per cent of the \ncommunity, who may be traveling three times further than average). This was noted in many counties where KRCS is \nresponding. As such, this revised appeal seeks to increase water access through installation or rehabilitation of water \npoints. This is critical as food security interventions should be aligned with adequate access to water. KRCS therefore \nsees the need to scale up the interventions, especially in the counties in the alarm phase.  \n \nThe rate of malnutrition in 10 of the 14 selected counties is above the 15 per cent emergency threshold based on the \nresults of nutrition smart survey done as part of the short rains assessments. Turkana North, North Horr in Marsabit and \nMandera are Extremely Critical (IPC Phase 5), while Turkana Central is in Critical (IPC Phase 4) and Serious (Phase 3) \nin Turkana West, a slight deterioration compared to the same time last year. Analysis from neighbouring areas, East \nPokot and West Pokot, has also shown deterioration with the counties classified as Critical (Phase 4) and Serious (Phase \n3) respectively. Deterioration has also been noted in Tana River County, currently classified as Serious (Phase 3), \nMarsabit County classified as Critical (Phase 4) and Mandera, which is also classified as Critical (Phase 4). The total \nprojected caseload until October in 23 ASALs is 268,000 children under five years of age and 34,000 pregnant and \nlactating women (PLW) with 60 per cent of these in just five counties of Mandera, Turkana, West Pokot, Wajir and \nGarissa. \n \nIncreased drop-out rates of facility deliveries for expectant mothers due to strained household income, which would \nfacilitate transportation, often leads to increased maternal and new-born deaths. Compromised drug adherence for the \nindividuals on long term treatment due to lack of food, increases the severity of diseases for cases such as HIV there is \nincreased risk of transmission as the viral suppression is interfered with. High levels of malnutrition which weaken the \nimmune system thereby predisposing vulnerable groups to infections such as measles and other common ailments. \nGiven these alarming statistics, various health and nutrition interventions targeting acute and chronic malnutrition will be \nscaled up in next three to six months. \n \nThe operational strategy \n \nDue to poor performance of long rains in the months March to May 2016, some pastoral and marginal farming \ncommunities in the ASALs of the country are experiencing a severe drought, now classified as alert phase (10 counties) \nand alarm phase (13 counties). ASALs make up more than 80 per cent of the country\u2019s land mass and are home to \napproximately 36 per cent of the country\u2019s population. The ASALs have the lowest development indicators and the \nhighest incidence of poverty in the country.  \n \nThe Government of Kenya (GoK) declared the ongoing drought has affected 23 arid and semi-arid counties and pockets \nof other areas as a national disaster. Therefore, the GoK has appealed to all stakeholders, local and international \npartners to come in and support its efforts to contain the situation which, has not only affected human beings and \nlivestock but also wild animals by upscaling drought mitigation programmes.  \n \nKenya Food Security Steering Group Joint Long Rains assessment report published in August 2016, (KFSSG LRA) \nestimated that a total of 1,254,600 people, mainly from pastoral (750,900) and marginal agricultural areas (503,700), in \n19 ASAL counties were acutely food insecure, as they were directly affected by these poor rains, as well as other existing \nand emerging vulnerabilities and required immediate food assistance. KFSSG has also concluded the Short Rains \nAssessment (October-November-December), in February 2017 and the report indicates that the population requiring \nemergency humanitarian assistance to have increased to 2.7 million. Of the total affected population, 2.2 million are \nfacing food security crisis (IPC Phase 3). The GoK has further announced an increase of this population to about three \nmillion in mid-March and further projected to hit four million mark by mid-April. \n \nThe food security situation is expected to continue deteriorating in the months of March and April, with greater impacts \nin counties already in IPC phase 3. It is also expected that children, pregnant and lactating women as well as the aged, \nwill be the most affected by the food scarcity and the levels of acute malnutrition will increase rapidly among these \npopulation sub groups.  \n \nP a g e  | 3 \n \nNeeds assessment  \n \nThe National Drought Management Authority (NDMA) carries out seasonal field assessments after the rains seasons, \nto assess the impact of the rains on food security and human nutrition. The NDMA is the lead in assessments (as the \ngovernment agency dealing with matters of drought) and is supported by government ministries, United Nations \nAgencies (especially WFP and UNICEF), International and Local Non-Governmental Organisations in the assessments. \nThe assessments involve field data collection through 138 established sentinel sites spread across the ASAL areas. The \ncollected data is analysed and presented to the County Steering Groups (CSGs) in each of the participating counties for \nvalidation. \n \nThe recently concluded Short Rains Assessment (SRA) is indicative of a deteriorating situation, the effects of which are \nmirroring the drought of 2011. The report by NDMA classifies 10 counties to be in the alert phase and an additional 13 \ncounties to be at alarm phase of drought. A total of 343,559 children in ASALs require treatment for acute malnutrition \n(MAM - 268,549 and SAM \u2013 75,010), as well as 37,223 PLW. This is an increase from August 2016 when the equivalent \nfigures were 294,330 (MAM- 233,700 and SAM 60,600) and 29,500 PLW. The current caseloads were calculated using \nthe revised projected population for 2016. Various nutrition interventions targeting acute and chronic malnutrition are \nunderway in all counties and should be scaled up if the worst possible malnutrition outcomes are to be avoided in the \nnext three to six months. \n \nThe ongoing drought is already threatening learning amongst pupils with the risk of closure of schools due to a lack of \nwater, and the reported pipeline break by WFP which supports the School Meals Programme1. Although the government \nis looking to kick-start school feeding, this had not taken off by the second week of March. \n \nThe rate of malnutrition is above emergency levels in some areas and in other parts have serious acute malnutrition \nlevels. Further analysis indicates low dietary intake and household level food insecurity, coupled with high disease \nburden and localized outbreaks of cholera (Mandera, Marsabit, Wajir and Tana River) are the reasons for higher rate of \nmalnutrition. Furthermore, in the recent past in 2015 and part of 2016, cholera outbreaks affected several counties in \nthe country including Marsabit, Wajir, Mandera, Garissa, Baringo, Samburu, Isiolo and Tana River. According to the \n2016 KFSSG LRA report, most of the affected communities in the north-eastern parts of the country have very low latrine \ncoverage. Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions (SMART) surveys in June 2016, showed \nthat water treatment is equally low, at less than 20 per cent. Hand-washing practices are poor (less than 30 per cent \nwash their hands at the critical times).  \n \nKRCS is leading the response in nine of the affected counties, with integrated Health and Nutrition outreaches with \nfinancial support from UNICEF although this requires a significant scale up. These outreaches focus on Mass screening \nfor Malnutrition, onsite case management using the Integrated Management of Acute Malnutrition (IMAM) guidelines. \nChildren with severe acute malnutrition and with medical complications are managed in selected Nutrition \nRehabilitation/stabilisation centres (the Inpatient Therapeutic Feeding (ITFC)) and KRCS will support the running of such \ncentres especially in North Horr, Mandera East and Turkana North East. Referrals of cases that need advanced care, \nimmunization, antenatal care, referrals for obstetric emergencies including deliveries, treatment of common ailments, \nreferrals for GBV cases, Psychological First Aid, referrals for counselling and Health promotion will also be undertaken. \nWith mass screening being done through targeted outreaches and treatment of the malnourished children under five \nyears. The interventions are also targeting other vulnerable groups, which include pregnant and lactating mothers, \npeople with chronic illnesses, the aged and people living with disabilities. The interventions are being supported \nfinancially by UNICEF, UNFPA and CBM. \n \nSummary of response to date \nSince the launch of the Emergency Appeal in November 2016, the KRCS has made the following progress towards the \noutcomes: \n \n\u2022 KRCS has been managing SAFARICOM M-PESA platform as a corporate user for close to five years \nnow. The platform which is based at the KRCS headquarters has been used as an effective mechanism \nfor the delivery of cash for this operation and previous Cash Transfer Programmes. Staff and volunteers \nare paid their subsistence allowances through this platform as well.  \n \n\u2022 2,300 households in Kilifi have received their second cash transfers (third transfers are planned for \nMarch 2017) while 1,000 households in Tana River have received their second disbursement. 3,900 \nhouseholds in Marsabit have received their second cash disbursement, 1,200 households have \n                                                 \n1 The school feeding programme is run by the Kenya government to support children in primary schools with free mid-day meals mainly \ncomprising of porridge and maize and beans. \nP a g e  | 4 \n \nreceived their first round of cash transfer, 1,546 in Baringo have received two rounds of cash transfers \nand 3,250 in Turkana have received their first round of cash transfers.  \n \n\u2022 A beneficiary communication mechanism has been developed for Kilifi county. Reports on the \ncomplaints are being tracked by trained volunteers on a monthly basis. \n \n\u2022 381 goats were purchased and slaughter meat distributed to 9,358 people. The animals were \npurchased from 442 herders in Tana River county. Likewise, 4,501 goats and 297 cattle were \npurchased and slaughtered in Ijara county. Lastly, 5,864 people received meat from animals purchased \nfrom 440 farmers in Garisa county. \n \n\u2022 A total of 2,000 nutrition outreach sessions have been conducted in Loiyangalani and North Horr \ncounty.  \n \n\u2022 Seven boreholes have been rehabilitated in Kwale, five in Isiolo and one in Garissa county. \n \n\u2022 \nIn Kilifi 500 households received food assistance in December 2016. In Baringo 3,300 households (19,800 \npeople) received food rations for two months in February and March 2017. In Kwale 3,800 households \n(19,000 people) received food in December 2016 and 2,500 households received food rations (1,550 in \nTurkana east and south, and 950 in Turkana north) in February and March 2017. In Samburu, 917 \nhouseholds received food in December 2016 and in Lamu 443 households (2,215 persons) received food \nin February 2017.  \n \nBeneficiary selection \nInterventions will be aligned with the IFRC-minimum standard commitments to gender and diversity in emergency \nprogramming, for example the selection of beneficiaries has been based on their level of vulnerability, including: \nhouseholds that have lost their source of livelihoods (loss of crops and animals), the chronically ill, elderly, female-\nheaded households, lactating mothers and under-five children (malnourished), pregnant women, and/or people with \ndisabilities. The KRCS has been working closely with the GoK, stakeholders and other agencies to ensure that there will \nbe no duplication of interventions.  \n \nOverall objective \nThe overall objective of this revised appeal is to meet the immediate needs of 1,033,300 drought-affected persons in 14 \npriority counties by scaling up nutrition interventions and basic health services, access to water, hygiene and sanitation \nand food security. This is an increase from 340,786 people in 13 counties targeted in the previous appeal launched in \nFebruary 2017. \n \nCoordination and partnerships \nParticipating National Societies (PNSs) hosted by the KRCS include: the American, Austrian, British, Danish, Finnish, \nGerman, Japanese and Norwegian Red Cross. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) regional \ndelegation is also hosted in Nairobi, which serves as a hub for operations in eastern and central African countries.  \n \nThrough this appeal, the British Red Cross, Danish Red Cross and Finnish Red Cross have been supporting KRCS \nbilaterally, while the American Red Cross, Canadian Red Cross, Austrian Red Cross, German Red Cross, Japanese \nRed Cross (including contributions from the Japanese Government), the Netherlands Red Cross, Italian Red Cross, \nSwedish Red Cross and Monaco Red Cross have supported through the IFRC. British Red Cross has also provided \nadditional resources through the IFRC. The ICRC regional delegation in Nairobi has also provided support, and has \npledged to support Lamu and Tana River (Tana Delta) counties. KRCS has kept the Movement partners, individually \nand through joint briefings, updated on progress in supporting the affected communities, and further consulted a number \nof them on the need to revise the appeal. \n \nResponse actions have been initiated and are ongoing in nine of the affected counties by the national and county \ngovernments. The activities are supported by various ministries; Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation, Ministry of \nDevolution and Planning and the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries and the Ministry of Health. Other \nagencies involved include; National Drought Management Authority (NDMA), Hunger Safety Net Programme (HSNP), \nWorld Food Programme (WFP), Food Agriculture Organisation (FAO), Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), German \nAgro Action (GAA).

Situation analysis \nDescription of the disaster \n \nThis report summarises the progress made in the last six months since the start of the operation.  The drought has \nseriously affected the lives of the people and the country\u2019s agricultural yields. Livestock deaths, food insecurity and \nwater scarcity has further compounded poor nutrition and health outcomes in communities as well as seriously \naffecting livelihoods and recovery abilities1. According to the Interagency and Government led assessments, up to \n120,000 people in five districts have been severely affected.  \n \nAffected communities have been using their regular coping mechanism including selling of livestock and assets, \nborrowing cash and food, reducing food portions, consuming seed and food from stores for the lean season and \nfinding new water sources. This coping mechanism is commonly seen during the lean and wet season in November to \nMarch.  \n \nRecent assessments by the CVTL teams suggested that food security and livelihoods recovery continue to be a \nprimary concern. The reported likelihood of a pending La Nina and resulting increase in seasonal rainfall still requires \nconfirmation and this may benefit some communities although the risk of additional hazards including flood and \n                                                     \n \n1 Office of the UN Resident Coordinator, Timor Leste (Sept,2016).  \nEmergency appeal operation update \nTimor Leste: Drought  \n \n2 \nlandslide remains a concern.2 Many vulnerable communities may continue to struggle through their annual lean \nseason due to the earlier El Nino and drought. Based on the experience from previous droughts, the recovery of some \ncommunities can take up to two years.3  \n \nSummary of current response \n \nOn 15 April 2016, CHF 215,752 was allocated via the IFRC\u2019s DREF to enable Cruz Vermelha de Timor-Leste (CVTL) to \nrespond to the initial needs of most affected communities. Following the household assessments conducted by CVTL, an \nemergency appeal of CHF 798,618 was launched on 18 May to scale up the operation to assist 20,000 people in the \ndistricts of Baucau, Lautem, and Viqueque.  \n \nInitial relief activities undertaken by CVTL include \ndistribution \nof \n5,776 \nwater \ncontainers \nin \n8 \ncommunities and 224,080 litres of water in 5 \ncommunities. \nHealth \npromotion \nconducted \nby \nbranch volunteers reached 7,034 individuals across \n17 communities and nutrition messaging and advice \nwere provided to 1,356 pregnant and nursing \nwomen \nidentified \nduring \nassessments \nas \na \nvulnerable group. Seven schools in the affected \nareas have had water catchment systems and \nstorage tanks installed to provide water for \nhousehold and school use, benefitting up to 762 \nhouseholds. \n \nOn 23 September, the appeal was revised to \nincrease the target households from 4,000 to 5,500 \nand to focus more on targeted food distribution, \nstrengthening livelihoods with seed distribution and \nan integration of health and nutrition activities. This \nstrategy was designed to prepare communities and improve resilience in preparation for the traditional lean season \nexpected during November to March every year. \n \nA tender was launched in September for the purchase of the food and seeds required for the planned distribution. The \nproposed lead time from suppliers was deemed too long and rejected by the operation team. To resolve and continue to \nmeet the targeted needs,  CVTL strategized to broaden the cash transfer programme (CTP). This was supported by a \nrecent livelihoods assessment and community consultation supported by the IFRC livelihoods advisor. The first cash \ndistribution is planned to commence on 19 October.   \n \nInstitutionally CVTL continue to strengthen their internal cooperation and planning activities to enable them to manage \ncompeting priorities. Efforts to integrate drought mitigation and recovery activities with development programming in the \nIntegrated Community Based Disaster Risk Reduction (ICBRR) are also ongoing. Readiness activities for the rainy \nseason have commenced with the requisition of relief supplies from IFRC Regional Logistics Unit in Kuala Lumpur for \n300 families. These are to be pre-positioned in CVTL branches in each of the three drought affected districts in \npreparation for the pending wet season. Branch Disaster Response Teams (BDRT) will undergo refresher training in \nViqueque during October. \n  \nOverview of Red Cross Red Crescent Movement in country \n \nThe IFRC have an office within the CVTL headquarters which supports the National Society with organizational \ndevelopment, representation and drought operations. A consortium of Australian, British, South Korean and New \nZealand Red Cross societies support longer term integrated risk reduction activities (ICBRR) across 25 districts in \nTimor-Leste. The IFRC Country Cluster Support Team (CCST) in Jakarta and the Asia Pacific Regional Office (APRO) \nin Kuala Lumpur support coordination of Movement partners, provide technical advice and ensure dissemination of \nCVTL activities and progress towards the achievement of operational goals. \n \nCVTL, with the support of IFRC, will host a partnership meeting in November. The relevant stakeholders and \nMovement partners will be updated on the progress to date.   \n \n \n \n                                                     \n \n2 Rapid drought assessment report, MAF Government of Timor Leste (2016) \n3 \u201cSeeds of Life\u201d Timor Leste (2015) \nCommunity water distribution in Werumata Village, Bacau District \n(Photo: CVTL) \n \n3 \nCoordination with public authorities and local actors   \n \nThe Timor-Leste Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) is convened under the leadership of the Minister of Interior, \nMinister of Social Solidarity, the United Nations Resident Coordinator, and PLAN International. Its membership \nincludes local and international humanitarian and development agencies, UN and representatives of the diplomatic \ncommunity. At a national and local level CVTL and IFRC have regular communication with Government, HCT \nmembers and working thematic clusters to plan and coordinate relief and recovery efforts where relevant.   \n \nCVTL along with the central and local government representatives marked the  International Disaster Risk Reduction \n(IDRR) day in Manufahi. CVTL volunteers in Bacau delivered a demonstration of their value and expertise during the \nUN Special envoy for El Nino and Climate Change\u2019s visit in July. CVTL response teams took part in a tsunami drill \nheld in and around the capital of Dili as part of the regional exercise \u2018IOWave2016\u2019.  \n \nDiscussions are ongoing with the WFP to partner in the distribution of supplementary nutrition. This partnership is \nmotivated by the allocation (USD 846,700) from UN Central Emergency Response Fund to support 21,000 people \naffected by the drought.  \n \nA mapping of HCT members and activities in Timor Leste including CVTL was carried out with the support of British \nRed Cross in September and is being regularly updated. \n \n \nBritish Red Cross/Timor Leste HCT (September 2016) \n \nB. Operational strategy and plan \nOverall Objective \nThe overall objective of this operation remains unchanged and is to provide 27,500 people affected by drought, \nattributed to El Ni\u00f1o, in the districts of Baucau, Viqueque and Lautem with appropriate assistance in a timely, effective, \nand efficient manner, and support them to recover from the impact of the drought and increase their resilience to \nfuture shocks. \n \nRevised strategy \n \nAs a result of the revision to the operation which occurred on 23 September 2016, health and hygiene activities were \nmerged and more emphasis was placed on livelihoods to promote resilience and recovery with Cash Transfer \n \n4 \nProgramme (CTP) reinforced as a primary tool. The target population assessed as being vulnerable was increased \nfrom 20,000 to 27,500 after further analysis. \n \nThe desired outcomes are as follows: \n \n1. Ensure adequate water supply and hygiene awareness in areas of greatest vulnerability.  \n2. Promote the consumption of nutritious foods and the increase of household food production \n3. Provide livelihood support to extend longer-term coping mechanisms \n4. Support disaster risk reduction measures in communities  \n5. Support institutional disaster response capacity enhancement \n \nThe activities in this plan namely hygiene promotion, water and water container distribution, nutrition training  have \nrequired CVTL to engage in an ongoing basis with the twenty targeted communities. This has resulted in regular \ncontact and dialogue between CVTL branches and communities ensuring strong engagement and feedback \nmechanisms. The recent establishment of community recovery committees is a result of this dialogue and this \nmechanism will inform the ongoing work relating to cash transfers. \n \nIn October, CVTL have revalidate the original household data sets to ensure that programming continues to reach the \ntarget vulnerable people. \n \nIn an effort to maximise efficiencies and contact with affected remote communities promotional activities including \nhygiene messaging has been combined with distribution efforts. This strategy will continue in November when risk \nreduction and preparedness awareness will accompany hygiene kit distribution. The installation of water catchment \nsystems in ten schools has also provided the opportunity to engage school aged children in hygiene, nutrition and \nsafety messaging by branch staff and volunteers. \n \nA drought operation task force was formed at CVTL headquarters in September. This group comprising of department \nrepresentatives meets on a weekly basis to ensure the the plan of action is effectively and efficiently being \nimplemented and monitored. \n \nOperational support services  \n \nHuman resources \n \nTwo IFRC surge operations managers were provided with the support of Swiss Red Cross and British Red Cross. A \noperations manager was recruited in September for six months until the end of the operation. Peer to peer technical \nsurge was provided on two occasions in June and September by the Philippine Red Cross. The IFRC regional \nlivelihoods coordinator provided technical assistance during the livelihoods mapping assessment in September.   \n \nThis appeal continues to support the cost of eight CVTL staff employed specifically to implement this operation. \nSupported by the IFRC the CVTL livelihoods coordinator attended the recent Emergency Recovery Livelihoods \nAssessment training held in Manila in September. This experience was being applied in determining livelihood options \nduring the revision of the plan.     \n \nLogistics and supply chain \n \nLogistics activities aim to effectively manage the supply chain, including mobilization, procurement, customs \nclearance, fleet, storage and transport to distribution sites in accordance with the operation\u2019s requirements and \naligned to IFRC\u2019s logistics standards, processes and procedures. \n \nThe planned food procurement under this appeal was cancelled due to several constrains including long lead time. \nInstead, and in order to meet the needs in the field the modality was changed to cash transfer program. Further, with \nthe support of the IFRC regional logistics unit (RLU) in Kuala Lumpur the sourcing of jerry cans for immediate relief \ndistribution and family kits for prepositioning were done internationally to meet the operational timeframe and to \nensure the quality of the goods. Pending drought activities including the local purchase of hygiene kits and the \nrehabilitation of HQ and district warehousing. All procurement activities related to this appeal will follow the IFRC\u2019s \nstandards and procurement procedures.  \n \nIFRC regional logistics development delegate is supporting British Red Cross CVTL logistics capacity building \nprogram and lessons learnt in this operation will be incorporated into this development plan to maximize lessons in \nreal time. \n \n \n \n \n5 \nC.

Whilst the desired outcome for improving nutrition remains unchanged. The 2,700 households initially \nidentified with food needs will now receive cash transfers to purchase recommended nutritional food.  \n \nAll target households will be revalidated according to the eligibility criteria as determined by community recovery \ncommittees as part of the community engagement and feedback strategy. Each household will receive USD 50 to \npurchase food from the market. The development of CTP procedures, training and proposed sensitization of \ncommunity committees have been undertaken with the support of a peer advisor from the Philippine Red Cross. \n \nNutrition \nNutrition awareness and training sessions \nhave been conducted in 16 of the 20 \naffected villages, reacing total of 1,356 \npregnant and/or lactating women.

The resulting data collected identified the 5,500 households that will benefit \nfrom this operation as well as the 2,700 households identified as being candidates for the CTP. Prior to the \ncommencement of the CTP in October, each community will have its data revalidated with a fresh assessment and \nanalysis. A pilot livelihoods assessment and seasonal mapping took place in two villages in Lautem in September. \nIts purpose was to establish a more recent baseline and seasonal calendar to inform livelihood options. This \ninitiative resulted in the confirmation and establishment of cash transfer programme as the primary livelihood and \nnutrition activity. \n \nCommunity engagement and accountability  \nCommunity engagement has been refocused with the establishment of community recovery committees to support \nthe implementation of CTP and to disseminate information to affected communities. These groups are \nrepresentative of communities and include the vulnerable, women and established leadership. Each committee is \nalso responsible for the revalidation of beneficiary data and engagement with branch volunteers and staff for the \ndistribution of cash. A complaints hotline has been activated at the CVTL headquarters data on the outcomes of any \ncalls was not available but will be analysed to inform programming in real time. \n \nMonitoring  \nInformal recording of activities by CVTL staff and volunteers is ongoing. This will require continued strengthening to \nmeet more formal reporting requirements but also to establish evidence based indicators of change and impact over \nthe longer term. This is viewed as important by CVTL especially in relation to hygiene promotion and cash transfer \nactivities. A monitoring template has been established to accompany the revised plan of action. Outside of this \nappeal, a peer support from Indonesian Red Cross (PMI), with support from IFRC and British Red Cross, has \nrecently conducted a PMER capacity assessment in CVTL. This will be used to guide future development of CVTL\u2019s \nPMER system. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n11 \n \n \n \n \nReference \ndocuments \n\uf0e6\uf020\nClick here for: \n\uf0b7 \nRevised \nEmergency \nAppeal \n \n\uf0b7 \nRevised \nPlan of \nAction \n \n\uf0b7 \nInterim \nFinancial \n \nContact Information \nFor further information specifically related to this operation please contact: \n \nIn CVTL, Dili  \n\uf0b7 \nJanuario Ximenes, Secretary General, email: januarioximenes_cvtl@recdross.tl   \n\uf0b7 \nHermenegildo Cardoso Rente, Disaster Management Coordinator,  \nphone: +670 7526 2063, email: hermenegildo_cvtl@redcross.tl  \n \nIn Dili, IFRC Country Team \n\uf0b7 \nGlenn Rose, Operations Manager, email: glenn.rose@ifrc.org  \n \nIn IFRC Country Cluster Support Team, Jakarta:  \n\uf0b7 \nGiorgio Ferrario, Head of CCST; email: giorgio.ferrario@ifrc.org    \n  \nIn Asia Pacific Regional Office, Kuala Lumpur: \n\uf0b7 \nMartin Faller, Deputy Director; email: martin.faller@ifrc.org   \n\uf0b7 \nNelson Castano, Head of DCPRR; email: nelson.castano@ifrc.org   \n\uf0b7 \nNecephor Mghendi, Operations Coordinator; mobile: +60 12 224 6796; \nemail: necephor.mghendi@ifrc.org \n \nFor resource mobilization and pledges: \n\uf0b7 \nDiana Ongiti, Relationship Manager; mobile +60 12 371 2004; email: diana.ongiti@ifrc.org \n\uf0b7 \nPlease send all pledges for funding to zonerm.asiapacific@ifrc.org  \n \nFor in-kind donations: \n\uf0b7 \nRiku Assamaki, Regional Logistics Coordinator; email: riku.assamaki@ifrc.org  \n \nFor communications enquiries: \n\uf0b7 \nPatrick Fuller, Communications Manager; email: patrick.fuller@ifrc.org  \n \nFor planning, monitoring, evaluation and reporting (PMER) enquiries \n\uf0b7 \nPeter Ophoff, Head of PMER, email: peter.ophoff@ifrc.org  \n \nIn IFRC Geneva \n\uf0b7 \nChristine South, Operations Quality Assurance Senior Officer;  \nemail: christine.south@ifrc.org  \n\uf0b7 \nSusil Perera, senior officer, response and recovery; email: susil.perera@ifrc.org \n \nHow we work \nAll IFRC assistance seeks to adhere to the Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent \nMovement and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO\u2019s) in Disaster Relief and the Humanitarian Charter \nand Minimum Standards in Humanitarian Response (Sphere) in delivering assistance to the most \nvulnerable.

A DREF loan of CHF 129,394 has been processed to SRCS. \n \n \nA. Situation analysis \n \nDescription of the disaster \n \nAugust 2015: Poor post-GU (long rains) exacerbates drought conditions leading to reduced pasture land, water \nshortages and deaths of livestock. This has increased the number of acutely food insecure people to emergency \nlevels, with 38% of the Somalia population acutely food insecure and 304,700 children < 5 years of age acutely \nmalnourished. Reports indicate that 4.7 million people are food insecure with an estimated 930,000 already in \nIntegrated Phase classification (IPC) Phase 3 (crisis) and 22,000 in Phase 4 (emergency). Without humanitarian \nassistance the situation will deteriorate. \nJanuary 2016: Governments of Somaliland and Puntland declare the drought an emergency.  \nFebruary 2016: IFRC Surge Capacity deployed to support the Somali Red Crescent Rapid Situational and Needs \nAssessment  \nEmergency Plan of Action operation update \nSomalia: Drought \n | 2 \nP a g e\n \nMarch 2016: Emergency Appeal launched for 1,290,936 Swiss francs. IFRC`s Disaster Emergency Relief Fund \n(DREF) of 129,394 Swiss francs allocated to support the start of assistance. Some reasonable rains have since the \nlaunch of this Appeal occurred in most parts of Somaliland and Puntland, particularly the western part of Somaliland \nthat was severely affected by the drought. The Eastern parts of Somaliland, including the intervention areas under the \nAppeal have however not received such heavy rains. \n11 April 2016: Operations Update 1 published covering the first 2 weeks of the operations \n \nThis update covers information for 1 month since the launch of the operation. \n \nSummary of current response \n \nOverview of Host National Society \n \nThe Somali Red Crescent Society is currently providing Health and Care services through its Mobile and Static Clinics \nthrough its Integrated Health Care Programme (IHCP). The mobile and static clinics provide immunization (mother \nand child), treatment of common illnesses, Nutrition screening, Out Patient Therapeutic Feeding Programme (OTP),, \nTherapeutic Supplementary Feeding Programme (TFSP), Maternal Child Health Nutrition (MCHN) ,Reproductive \nHealth (ante-natal, post-natal, delivery services) and health education in some of the areas that are currently affected \nby the drought. The National Society is operating a total of 12 static and 6 mobile clinics in Somaliland and 20 static \nand 4 mobile clinics in Puntland through multilateral support from Partner National Societies (PNS) and in \ncollaboration with the sector Ministry, UNICEF, WHO and WFP. \n \nThe SRCS, with the support of the German Red Cross is implementing an ECHO funded operation supporting \ncommunities in Maroodijeeh and Awdal Regions as part of the drought response. Through the ECHO project the \nSRCS has reached an estimated 28,810 households with clean water for household consumption as well as food \nsecurity support through cash grants for alternative livelihoods and health interventions in the above named areas. \n \nThe National Society is also implementing a number of projects including Youth Development, CBHFA, HIV \nprogramme, Restoring Family Links and a Community Resilience programme with 3 main components; WATSAN, \nLivelihoods, Drought Resilience and Climate Change Adaptation.  This is through the support of Red Cross/Red \nCrescent Movement Partner National Societies (PNS) both multilaterally through IFRC or bilaterally. \n \nThe SRCS has built a wealth of capacity and experience in responding to emergencies. Since 2011, DREF and \nEmergency Appeal operations have been carried out in response to the 2010/2011 drought which affected Puntland \nand Somaliland (MDRSO001 Emergency APPEAL) and Population Movement (MDRSO002 DREF) into Puntland and \nSomaliland following the Yemeni crisis since March 2015. The National Society (NS) will build on the experience and \nlessons learned from these operations (as relevant) in the response to the current emergency. Recommendations \nfrom the Drought Evaluation Report MDRSO001, Drought 2011, will be incorporated in implementing the current \ndrought response activities as a lessons learnt. \n \nOverview of Red Cross Red Crescent Movement in country \n \nThe German Red Cross (GRC) has bilateral resilience and other programmes/projects with the National Society in \nselected communities in Somaliland and Puntland. The GRC is also leading a consortium with the Finnish Red Cross \nto support response to the drought in 2 regions badly affected by the drought in Somaliland with funding from ECHO. \n \nThe Federation is supporting health and organizational development interventions in both Puntland and Somaliland \nthrough multilateral support. The Norwegian Red Cross equally provides bilateral support to the SRCS in the running \nof Rehabilitation Centres in all the 3 zones of the country \u2013 Puntland, Somaliland and South/Central Somalia. The \nQatar Red Crescent also provides bilateral support to 2 static health clinics managed by the SRCS in Somaliland. \n \nThe ICRC supports National Society health interventions, water and sanitation as well as food security interventions in \nSouth/Central Somalia in particular and to some extent in Somaliland and Puntland.  \n \nOverview of non-RCRC actors in country \n \nThe Government Disaster Response arms, such as the National Environment Research and Disaster Preparedness \nand Management Authority (NERAD) in Somaliland and the Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management \nAgency (HADMA) in Puntland, have overall coordination of all responses to disasters and emergencies in the \nrespective zones. The UNOCHA plays the coordination role through mapping of what different agencies are or plan to \nintervene in most regions affected by the drought.  \n \n | 3 \nP a g e\n \n \n \nBelow are the names and activities of organizations with relevant response interventions in Somaliland: \n \nOrganization \nType of Response \nUNICEF \nPlans to rehabilitate 10 boreholes \nConcern Worldwide \nWell construction, borehole drilling and cash for work \nactivities \nSave the Children \nEmergency Health interventions through Mobile Clinics, \nwater trucking and distribution of NFIs and maintenance \nof Berkeds \nCare International \nBorehole rehabilitation \nIslamic Organisation \nWater trucking and  Food Assistance  \nWFP \nGeneral Food Distribution  \nWorld Vision \nSupplementary feeding for the malnourished \nGurmad Foundation (Arab Diaspora) \nWater trucking and food distribution \nNorwegian Refugee Council \nCash for food \nDanish Refugee Council \nCash Transfer \n \n \nNeeds analysis and scenario planning \n \nPlease refer to the Original Plan of Action (MDRSO005) for information on the operation, including on the operational \nstrategy and plan, and operational support needs. \n \n \nB.

Operational Support Services \n \nHuman resources \nThe recruitment of staff and volunteers to operate the 6 mobile clinics - 4 in Somaliland under the Sool and Sanaag \nregions and 2 in Puntland in the Nugal region was finalized and staff are currently on the job.  Each mobile clinic has a \ncore staff of 3 \u2013 a nurse, a midwife and an auxiliary nurse, together with a driver and 2 volunteer mobilizers. \nSRCS finalized the recruitment of the National Society operational structure at field level. Job descriptions for the key \npositions were developed and the positions were filled by mid-April pending funding availability initially. The operation \nhas 3 SRCS Disaster Management National Staff (1 for Somaliland and 2 for Puntland considering the coverage).  \nAn IFRC Disaster Management Officer has been recruited by the IFRC Somali Country Office to support the National \nSociety with the implementation of the operation.  \n  \n \n \n \n \n | 9 \nP a g e\n \nLogistics and Supply Chain. \n \nThe logistics responsibilities will include sourcing the most urgent and relevant relief items, delivered and distributed \nequitably to those in need, in a timely, transparent and cost-efficient manner. Standard IFRC logistics procedures will \nbe followed and reported upon while providing technical surge capacity support during procurement, training and \nadvice to the host National Society and Federation delegates and staff. \nThe IFRC Somalia Country Office has discussed the procurement and logistics component of the Appeal with the \nIFRC Africa Region Logistics Delegate and would follow the process through with the advice of the Logistics Delegate. \n \nProcurement of OPD kits is currently being carried out through the IFRC Global Logistics Service in Geneva in \naccordance with the IFRC standard procurement procedures. Discussion between SRCS/IFRC Somalia Country \nOffice commenced with UNICEF for the supply of the plumpy nuts and bb5 biscuits for the treatment and prevention of \nmalnutrition. \n \nSRCS is in the process of procuring equipment such as blood pressure machines, mats, chairs and tables, \nstethoscopes, etc. \n \nInformation technologies (IT) \n \nSince Cash Transfer Programming will be part of the intervention, there is a need to purchase mobile phones for the \ntargeted beneficiaries. Selection will be based on a basic mobile phone. Airtime costs for staff and volunteers will be \nbudgeted for to ensure they are able to communicate while in the areas of intervention / implementation. The IFRC will \ndiscuss this with SRCS during the inception meeting. \n \nHowever the purchase of mobile phones costs were not factored in the budget, but will be considered during revision \nof the Emergency APPEAL. \n \nCash transfer training has been proposed for the 2nd May 2016 to 5th May 2016 \n \nCommunications \n \nThe Somali Red Crescent Society, in collaboration with the IFRC Somalia country representation, with support from \nIFRC Africa regional communications, aims to coordinate various awareness and publicity activities, to sensitize the \npublic, media and donors on the humanitarian response situation on the ground.  \n \nPlanned Activities: \n\uf0b7 \nProduce monthly information bulletins, facts and figures, key messages etc. and share with relevant stakeholders, \nincluding beneficiaries and partners supporting the operation \n\uf0b7 \nIn collaboration with programmes, work on advocacy message to address the different issues linked to the current \nconflict (health, food security, GBV, etc.) \n\uf0b7 \nNews releases, fact sheets, videos, photographs and qualified spokespeople contacts are immediately developed \nand made available to media and key stakeholders. When security allows, facilitate media field trips to affected \nareas to create awareness \n\uf0b7 \nProduce IEC materials \n\uf0b7 \nMaintain a social media presence throughout the operation utilizing IFRC sites such as Facebook and Twitter \n\uf0b7 \nSupport the launch of this Appeal and other major milestones throughout the operation using people-centred, \ncommunity level diverse content, including web stories, blogs, video footage and photos with extended captions. \nShare any communications material created through this appeal with IFRC and ICRC for use on various \ncommunications channels including the IFRC Africa web page, www.ifrc.org/africa  \n\uf0b7 \nBuild the communications capacity of the NS communication team through training and provision of appropriate \nequipment, if needed (photo and video camera) \n\uf0b7 \nAs security might reduce the possibility of doing a field visit, training should be organized for the DM team or other \ncolleagues so they can collect material (photos, quotes) as they go to the field. \n \n | 10 \nP a g e\n \nSecurity \n \nThe IFRC Somalia Country Office is providing regular security briefings that indicate the level of security and \nmeasures to be taken for prevention and mitigation in case the situation deteriorates. \nThe IFRC has a Security Advisor who will support and work closely with the Somalia Country Office through the \nmonitoring of the security situation and guidance on how the operation will be implemented. The IFRC Staff who \nattended the  startup meeting sought security clearance from the Security Advisor before undertaking the field mission \nto Somaliland on the 10th and 11th April 2016. Further to this, the Security advisor will be training the IFRC and SRCS \nstaff as well as volunteers working directly with the operation  on `Safer Access` and the `Do no Harm` concept as \npart of the staff and volunteer training.  \n \nPlanning, Monitoring, Evaluation, & Reporting (PMER) \n \nThe IFRC Somalia Country Office supported an inception workshop which took place between 10 and 11 April 2016 in \nHargeisa, Somaliland. This workshop included IFRC and SRCS technical staff who are involved in the implementation \nof the Appeal. This meeting discussed the entire content of the response and how the activities are going to be \nimplemented within the 6-month period of the Appeal.  \n \nHere are some points that were discussed during meeting: \n  \nStrategy of mobile clinic deployment, including: \n\uf0b7 \nNumbers of stations (villages), numbers of expected visits and access for beneficiaries (distance) \n\uf0b7 \nBeneficiaries mobilization strategy: how to make sure children admitted in the nutrition program are coming back \nfor follow up visits; communication plan with communities on program, visit schedule, malnutrition sensitization. \n\uf0b7 \nAdmission criteria and cured criteria according to nutrition protocols \n\uf0b7 \nReferral system if needed (for severely malnourished and sick children who might need in-patient capacity clinic \nfor follow up) \n\uf0b7 \nProject Indicators and reporting timelines (monitoring framework): the nutrition mobile clinic is a good way to follow \nup the trends of malnutrition among the population, and it will be useful to justify any required update to the \nstrategy \n  \nOn CTP: \n\uf0b7 \nTendering process \n\uf0b7 \nMarket survey \n\uf0b7 \nCTP training (as required) \n \nRehabilitation of borehole/berkeds/fuel subsidy: \n\uf0b7 \nNumber for each region  \n\uf0b7 \nLocation of boreholes for rehabilitation and fuel subsidy \n\uf0b7 \nNumber of borehole to benefit from fuel subsidy \n\uf0b7 \nQuantity of fuel for each borehole \n  \nGeneral: \n\uf0b7 \nLogistic requirement (include Region Log on CTP and other international procurement (OPD kit) to respect IFRC \nSOPs) \n | 11 \nP a g e\n \n\uf0b7 \nStrategy on prioritization of activities as the funding of the appeal is not guaranteed (and might be low, because of \nthe nature of the operation, based on previous experiences) \nThe operation will ensure that all aspects of the implemented components are monitored and specific tools are \ndeveloped/modified as necessary taking cognizance of gender and age disaggregation of data. The IFRC Regional \nDisaster Crisis Prevention, Response and Recovery Department and EAIOI PMER units will provide technical support, \nand ensure that monitoring and reporting structures are established. \n \nAdministration and Finance \n \nA Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been prepared for signing   between IFRC Somalia Country Office and \nthe SRCS, and it outlines the parties\u2019 responsibilities in implementing the planned activities within the Emergency \nAPPEAL and also ensures that the appropriate guidelines are complied with in terms of the use of the funding \nallocations.  \nThe HR set up for the operations management of the EA activities by SRCS and IFRC, has been designed taking into \naccount Lessons Learned from the 2010/2011 Drought which affected Puntland and Somaliland (MDRSO001 \nEmergency APPEAL) and Population Movement (MDRSO002 DREF) into Puntland and Somaliland following the \nYemeni crisis since March 2015.  The National Society (NS) is building on the experience and lessons learned from \nthese operations (as relevant) in the response to the current emergency. Recommendations from the Drought \nEvaluation Report MDRSO001, Drought 2011 are being incorporated in implementing the current drought response \nactivities as a lessons learnt. This has already kicked off and is evident from the rapid needs assessment conducted \nbetween 23rd to 28th February 2016 and a start-up meeting conducted on the 10th and 11th April 2016. This will ensure \nproper project implementation and accountability \n \n A review of the Emergency Plan of Action will be based on the adequacy of the unpredicted \u201cGu\u201d (long rains. \nD.

The expanded operation will focus on the following \nsectors: health; water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH); livelihood, nutrition, food security. It also reflects a \nsubstantial increase in the target population, number of activities, an enlarged geographic scope and timeframe for \nimplementation. The current funding gap is 11,742,626 Swiss francs. This Appeal takes in to account the findings and \nrecommendations of the comprehensive meher (main crop season) assessment conducted by the Government of \nEthiopia (GoE) and its partners, including the ERCS, in November and December 2016. The planned response reflects \nthe current situation and information available at this time of the evolving operation, and will be adjusted based on further \ndevelopments and more detailed assessments.

According to the GoE, the positive impact of the 2016 summer kiremt/gu/ganna rains and the \nsubsequent above-average meher harvest rains in northern and western parts of the country significantly \nreduced the number of people requiring food assistance from 10.2 million in 2016 to 5.6 million in 2017. \nHowever, the impact of the Indian Ocean Dipole1 and the failure of the autumn deyr/hagaya rains have \nnegatively impacted the food security of pastoralist households in southern and south-eastern lowland areas \nand in pockets of areas throughout the country. The October to December rains started late and were infrequent \nespecially in the southern and south eastern parts of the country, resulting in rivers drying up in several areas \nincluding Somali, Oromia and SNNP regions. In these areas, the total cumulative rainfall was well below \naverage coupled with equally below average March to May 2016 rains thereby compounding the existing \ndrought situation. The consecutive poor rainfall seasons have resulted in poor water and pasture regeneration \nand dried out water sources. This has led to death of livestock, high levels of malnutrition and food insecurity.  \n \nThe ERCS and GoE counterparts from the department of agriculture, livestock and disaster preparedness at \nthe zone level carried out assessments in Moyale district in November 2016. The assessment findings reflected \nevidence of emaciated animals, drying up of water sources and increased malnutrition. Further assessments \nin SNNP and Oromia regions in January 2017 confirmed similar situations of abnormal livestock deaths, lack \nof water, drying up of even the most reliable rivers in the region, and lack of pasture. The findings of these \nassessments were key in prioritizing geographic as well as sectoral areas for intervention in the revised appeal.   \n \nIn Afar and northern parts of Somali region, however, near normal rains were experienced in November \nresulting in water and pasture regeneration and generally improved food security and nutrition. Coincidentally, \nthese good rainfall conditions are conducive for the ERCS planned livestock re- stocking programme that will \nbe carried out in March to May 2017.  \n \nIt is against this background that on 17 January 2017, the Government of Ethiopia launched the 2017 \nHumanitarian Requirements Document (HRD) seeking US$948 million to reach 5.6 million people with \nemergency food and non-food assistance.   \n \nNeeds assessment  \nA rapid assessment was conducted by the ERCS in Moyale district in Somali region in November 2016. This \nwas followed up by rapid assessments conducted in Kindo and Koysha districts of Oromia region and Male, \nBena, Tsemay and Hamer districts of Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People\u2019s Region (SNNPR) region in \nFebruary 2017.  \n \nAssessment findings conclude that Kindo and Koysha districts of Oromia region have been assessed and \nranked as priority 1 compared to priority 3 from the assessment conducted in November 2016. The findings \nhighlight needs in the following areas: \n \nWASH: In Moyale district, Muti Ambo, Dembi, Tuka, Argene, Medo, Bokola, Lega Sire, Bede and Tilo Kebeles2 \nhave been severely affected by drought. 35 out of 50 ponds have dried up, with the remaining 15 ponds having \na limited amount of water, which is contaminated by faeces. Some families reported travelling up to 30km for \ndrinking water, where 20 litres of water cost about 25 birr (1.12 Swiss francs). School attendance has reduced \nby about 50 per cent in some Kebeles due to the lack of water.   \n \nIn Kindo and Koysha districts, three major rivers and eight artificial ponds have dried up as well as individual \nfarmer water conservation ponds. Nine out of 13 Kebeles have no access to water at all; water is usually brought \nin from outside or livestock travels 35-40km in search of water in neighbouring districts. In Male, Bena, Tsemay \nand Hamer districts, there are some non-functioning shallow wells and deep wells. Zone administration is \ntrucking water with one truck assigned to each district. District offices are requesting additional trucks as the \nnumber of beneficiaries is increasing. \n \nFood security: In Moyale district, reduction in milk availability has impacted the nutritional status of the milk-\ndependent pastoralist children under five who are at high risk of malnutrition. In Kindo and Koysha district \n19,000 people registered with Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) and 5,100 people receiving basic \nfood rations. However, there is a shortage of water for cooking. GoE started school feeding programme in nine \nmost affected kebeles and all Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM) cases are receiving assistance from GoE. In \n                                                 \n1 http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/enso/history/ln-2010-12/IOD-what.shtml \n \n2 Kebeles is the smallest administration unit of Ethiopia. \nP a g e  | 3 \n \n \nMale district, the zone administration is distributing food under the PSNP for those registered as well as \nsupplementary food for lactating and pregnant women. \n \nLivelihoods:  In Moyale district, 80 per cent of pastoralists derive 70 per cent of their income from livestock \nsales and products. Shortage of pasture and water due to recurrent drought has adversely affected livestock \nproduction resulting in poor livestock body condition, death of new-borns and occurrence of livestock diseases. \nA total of 137 livestock have died and 71 cattle are diseased and there is a decline in livestock market prices.  \n \nIn Kindo and Koysha district natural pasture has dried up due to the drought.  A total of 139,368 cattle, 27,696 \ngoats and 9,213 sheep remain at risk of starvation. Cattle are visibly losing weight and are too weak to travel \nto find water and pasture. Children are reportedly dropping out of school to look for water for livestock. While   \nin Bena Tsemay and Hamer districts high death rates of cattle are reported. The cattle are prone to diseases \nlike bovine pastoralises due to low immunity they have as a result of the lack of fodder and water.  \n \nHealth: In Moyale district, the health centre has only one ambulance and limited emergency drugs available.  \nMalnutrition screening was carried out to identify Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) in October 2016 while \nmeasles screening is still ongoing. Overall health service delivery is not achieving its\u2019 targets, especially the \nexpanded programmes on immunisation, family planning, anti-natal care, post-natal care and child delivery. \n \nIn Kindo and Koysha districts 69 Health Extension Workers (HEWS) are active. As this area is endemic for \nmalaria, there is a need for awareness on the use of mosquito nets.  A small outbreak of Acute Watery Diarrhoea \n(AWD) was noted and controlled in February 2017. It was also noted there is a shortage of drugs for water-\nborne diseases in health centres. In Male, Bena, Tsemay and Hamer districts over 100 MAM cases have been \nreported. These districts also have high prevalence of malaria-prone, however the situation is being closely \nmonitored by the Government. \n \nSummary of response to date \nSince the launch of the Emergency Appeal in January 2016, the ERCS has been able to provide: \n \n\uf0b7 \nFood distribution for 724 Pregnant and Lactating Women (PLW) and 2,289 under five children (934 \nfemales and 1,355 male) in which a two-month food ration for all 15 wards was also distributed. \n\uf0b7 \nHygiene promotion and messages on how to cook the Coy Soya Beans (CSB) were carried at the \ndistribution sites during distribution and were also given to the beneficiaries and care takers with a \nreach of 876 households.  \n\uf0b7 \nHealth promotion and nutrition messages on exclusive breastfeeding were given during distributions in \naddition to 770 women reached by the Community Based Health Care and First Aid (CBHFA) \nvolunteers. \n\uf0b7 \nPost distribution household visits were carried out by volunteers and project staff for 4,447 households \nincluding home visits, school health and sanitation clubs in four schools to monitor and provide \nguidance on behavioral change activities. \n\uf0b7 \nCBHFA training provided for 75 volunteers including provision of tool kit for all 75 volunteers with one \nset planned per volunteer. \n\uf0b7 \nA WASH needs assessment was conducted for a sample of 282 households in Bidu in which the \nrespondents were mainly women. \n\uf0b7 \nThe ERCS volunteers conducted household awareness on hygiene and sanitation, AWD, identification \nand monitoring of SAM cases and linking with the health facility.  \n\uf0b7 \nIn addition, the ERCS has been responding with its own funds and through support from Movement \nand external partners since the early stages of the drought. Overall, ERCS has assisted 56,546 under \nfive children and PLW with supplementary feeding, worth 840,000 Swiss francs from ERCS\u2019s own \nnational and regional fundraising efforts. \n \nBeneficiary Selection \nInterventions will be aligned with the IFRC-minimum standard commitments to gender and diversity in \nemergency programming, for example the selection of beneficiaries was based on their level of vulnerability, \nincluding: households that have lost their source of livelihoods (loss of crops and animals), the chronically ill, \nelderly, female-headed households, lactating mothers and under-five children (malnourished), pregnant \nwomen, and/or people with disabilities. The ERCS has been working closely with the Government, stakeholders \nand other agencies to ensure that there will be no duplication of interventions of activities.  \n \nOverall objective \nThe revised Emergency Appeal will assist 318,325 beneficiaries through the distribution of supplementary food, \nsupport to malnutrition screening and referral, community health services support, improved access to safe \nwater and hygiene promotion, and reinforcing family livelihoods and coping mechanisms. The supplementary \nP a g e  | 4 \n \n \nfood component in the revised Appeal targets families with children under five and pregnant and lactating \nmothers. \n \nCoordination and partnerships \nThe ERCS technical coordinators based in the headquarters Disaster Preparedness and Response Department \nparticipate in their respective clusters to allow for enhanced visibility of Red Cross Movement activities and \nensure coordination with non-Movement partners. The ERCS is part of the Drought Technical Working Group \norganised by the National Disaster Response Mission Commission (NDRMC) in Addis Ababa. At zonal and \nworeda3 level, the GoE has organised Drought Response Task Forces in which the ERCS branches participate. \n \nThe IFRC supports the ERCS through its East Africa and Indian Ocean Islands (EAIOI) Country Cluster Support \nTeam (CCST) and the Regional Office for Africa, which are both based in Nairobi, Kenya, and through an IFRC \nOperations Manager based in the ERCS headquarters in Addis Ababa. \n \nIn Ethiopia, the IFRC, ICRC and Partner National Societies (PNSs) participate in regular co-ordination meetings \nconvened by the ERCS. All issues including potential bilateral and multilateral actions are discussed. \nAdditionally, IFRC convenes regular co-ordination meetings in Nairobi with ICRC and PNS representatives to \nshare updates on the situation in Ethiopia and neighbouring countries, and Movement actions to date.  \n \nThere is an extensive PNS presence in Ethiopia, and all PNS\u2019s have different strategies to support the ERCS \ndrought emergency response. Discussion with the IFRC Country representative and the ERCS Secretary \nGeneral resulted in an agreement that all partners\u2019 drought response activities should be harmonised with the \nERCS National Drought Response Plan.  \n \nThe overall emergency response in Ethiopia is led by the NDRMC in close coordination with the Disaster Risk \nManagement Food Security Services (DRMFSS) of the Ministry of Agriculture. Sector task forces have been \nestablished at national, regional, zonal and woreda level with the participation of all stakeholders including the \nERCS. \n \nTo date, the GoE has allocated more than US$ 730 million to address critical humanitarian needs.  National \nand sub-national committees have been established to oversee the distribution of relief supplies, which include \nfood distributions, water point rehabilitation, livestock support, health services, and non-food items distribution \nfor the internally displaced families.  \n \nThe GoE, together with partners, has been able to respond to most of the increased health related needs \nattributed to drought. To maximise the response capacity, the GoE had divided the most affected woredas in \neach region amongst operational partners. With ongoing drought affecting mostly the southern and south \neastern areas, partners need to re-look at scaling up their operational presence in these areas and programme \nfocus to include emergency activities alongside their current development programmes. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n3 Woredas is the Ethiopian term for districts \nP a g e  | 5 \n \n

The expanded operation will focus on the following \nsectors: health; water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH); livelihood, nutrition, food security. It also reflects a \nsubstantial increase in the target population, number of activities, an enlarged geographic scope and timeframe for \nimplementation. The current funding gap is 11,742,626 Swiss francs. This Appeal takes in to account the findings and \nrecommendations of the comprehensive meher (main crop season) assessment conducted by the Government of \nEthiopia (GoE) and its partners, including the ERCS, in November and December 2016. The planned response reflects \nthe current situation and information available at this time of the evolving operation, and will be adjusted based on further \ndevelopments and more detailed assessments.

According to the GoE, the positive impact of the 2016 summer kiremt/gu/ganna rains and the \nsubsequent above-average meher harvest rains in northern and western parts of the country significantly \nreduced the number of people requiring food assistance from 10.2 million in 2016 to 5.6 million in 2017. \nHowever, the impact of the Indian Ocean Dipole1 and the failure of the autumn deyr/hagaya rains have \nnegatively impacted the food security of pastoralist households in southern and south-eastern lowland areas \nand in pockets of areas throughout the country. The October to December rains started late and were infrequent \nespecially in the southern and south eastern parts of the country, resulting in rivers drying up in several areas \nincluding Somali, Oromia and SNNP regions. In these areas, the total cumulative rainfall was well below \naverage coupled with equally below average March to May 2016 rains thereby compounding the existing \ndrought situation. The consecutive poor rainfall seasons have resulted in poor water and pasture regeneration \nand dried out water sources. This has led to death of livestock, high levels of malnutrition and food insecurity.  \n \nThe ERCS and GoE counterparts from the department of agriculture, livestock and disaster preparedness at \nthe zone level carried out assessments in Moyale district in November 2016. The assessment findings reflected \nevidence of emaciated animals, drying up of water sources and increased malnutrition. Further assessments \nin SNNP and Oromia regions in January 2017 confirmed similar situations of abnormal livestock deaths, lack \nof water, drying up of even the most reliable rivers in the region, and lack of pasture. The findings of these \nassessments were key in prioritizing geographic as well as sectoral areas for intervention in the revised appeal.   \n \nIn Afar and northern parts of Somali region, however, near normal rains were experienced in November \nresulting in water and pasture regeneration and generally improved food security and nutrition. Coincidentally, \nthese good rainfall conditions are conducive for the ERCS planned livestock re- stocking programme that will \nbe carried out in March to May 2017.  \n \nIt is against this background that on 17 January 2017, the Government of Ethiopia launched the 2017 \nHumanitarian Requirements Document (HRD) seeking US$948 million to reach 5.6 million people with \nemergency food and non-food assistance.   \n \nNeeds assessment  \nA rapid assessment was conducted by the ERCS in Moyale district in Somali region in November 2016. This \nwas followed up by rapid assessments conducted in Kindo and Koysha districts of Oromia region and Male, \nBena, Tsemay and Hamer districts of Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People\u2019s Region (SNNPR) region in \nFebruary 2017.  \n \nAssessment findings conclude that Kindo and Koysha districts of Oromia region have been assessed and \nranked as priority 1 compared to priority 3 from the assessment conducted in November 2016. The findings \nhighlight needs in the following areas: \n \nWASH: In Moyale district, Muti Ambo, Dembi, Tuka, Argene, Medo, Bokola, Lega Sire, Bede and Tilo Kebeles2 \nhave been severely affected by drought. 35 out of 50 ponds have dried up, with the remaining 15 ponds having \na limited amount of water, which is contaminated by faeces. Some families reported travelling up to 30km for \ndrinking water, where 20 litres of water cost about 25 birr (1.12 Swiss francs). School attendance has reduced \nby about 50 per cent in some Kebeles due to the lack of water.   \n \nIn Kindo and Koysha districts, three major rivers and eight artificial ponds have dried up as well as individual \nfarmer water conservation ponds. Nine out of 13 Kebeles have no access to water at all; water is usually brought \nin from outside or livestock travels 35-40km in search of water in neighbouring districts. In Male, Bena, Tsemay \nand Hamer districts, there are some non-functioning shallow wells and deep wells. Zone administration is \ntrucking water with one truck assigned to each district. District offices are requesting additional trucks as the \nnumber of beneficiaries is increasing. \n \nFood security: In Moyale district, reduction in milk availability has impacted the nutritional status of the milk-\ndependent pastoralist children under five who are at high risk of malnutrition. In Kindo and Koysha district \n19,000 people registered with Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) and 5,100 people receiving basic \nfood rations. However, there is a shortage of water for cooking. GoE started school feeding programme in nine \nmost affected kebeles and all Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM) cases are receiving assistance from GoE. In \n                                                 \n1 http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/enso/history/ln-2010-12/IOD-what.shtml \n \n2 Kebeles is the smallest administration unit of Ethiopia. \nP a g e  | 3 \n \n \nMale district, the zone administration is distributing food under the PSNP for those registered as well as \nsupplementary food for lactating and pregnant women. \n \nLivelihoods:  In Moyale district, 80 per cent of pastoralists derive 70 per cent of their income from livestock \nsales and products. Shortage of pasture and water due to recurrent drought has adversely affected livestock \nproduction resulting in poor livestock body condition, death of new-borns and occurrence of livestock diseases. \nA total of 137 livestock have died and 71 cattle are diseased and there is a decline in livestock market prices.  \n \nIn Kindo and Koysha district natural pasture has dried up due to the drought.  A total of 139,368 cattle, 27,696 \ngoats and 9,213 sheep remain at risk of starvation. Cattle are visibly losing weight and are too weak to travel \nto find water and pasture. Children are reportedly dropping out of school to look for water for livestock. While   \nin Bena Tsemay and Hamer districts high death rates of cattle are reported. The cattle are prone to diseases \nlike bovine pastoralises due to low immunity they have as a result of the lack of fodder and water.  \n \nHealth: In Moyale district, the health centre has only one ambulance and limited emergency drugs available.  \nMalnutrition screening was carried out to identify Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) in October 2016 while \nmeasles screening is still ongoing. Overall health service delivery is not achieving its\u2019 targets, especially the \nexpanded programmes on immunisation, family planning, anti-natal care, post-natal care and child delivery. \n \nIn Kindo and Koysha districts 69 Health Extension Workers (HEWS) are active. As this area is endemic for \nmalaria, there is a need for awareness on the use of mosquito nets.  A small outbreak of Acute Watery Diarrhoea \n(AWD) was noted and controlled in February 2017. It was also noted there is a shortage of drugs for water-\nborne diseases in health centres. In Male, Bena, Tsemay and Hamer districts over 100 MAM cases have been \nreported. These districts also have high prevalence of malaria-prone, however the situation is being closely \nmonitored by the Government. \n \nSummary of response to date \nSince the launch of the Emergency Appeal in January 2016, the ERCS has been able to provide: \n \n\uf0b7 \nFood distribution for 724 Pregnant and Lactating Women (PLW) and 2,289 under five children (934 \nfemales and 1,355 male) in which a two-month food ration for all 15 wards was also distributed. \n\uf0b7 \nHygiene promotion and messages on how to cook the Coy Soya Beans (CSB) were carried at the \ndistribution sites during distribution and were also given to the beneficiaries and care takers with a \nreach of 876 households.  \n\uf0b7 \nHealth promotion and nutrition messages on exclusive breastfeeding were given during distributions in \naddition to 770 women reached by the Community Based Health Care and First Aid (CBHFA) \nvolunteers. \n\uf0b7 \nPost distribution household visits were carried out by volunteers and project staff for 4,447 households \nincluding home visits, school health and sanitation clubs in four schools to monitor and provide \nguidance on behavioral change activities. \n\uf0b7 \nCBHFA training provided for 75 volunteers including provision of tool kit for all 75 volunteers with one \nset planned per volunteer. \n\uf0b7 \nA WASH needs assessment was conducted for a sample of 282 households in Bidu in which the \nrespondents were mainly women. \n\uf0b7 \nThe ERCS volunteers conducted household awareness on hygiene and sanitation, AWD, identification \nand monitoring of SAM cases and linking with the health facility.  \n\uf0b7 \nIn addition, the ERCS has been responding with its own funds and through support from Movement \nand external partners since the early stages of the drought. Overall, ERCS has assisted 56,546 under \nfive children and PLW with supplementary feeding, worth 840,000 Swiss francs from ERCS\u2019s own \nnational and regional fundraising efforts. \n \nBeneficiary Selection \nInterventions will be aligned with the IFRC-minimum standard commitments to gender and diversity in \nemergency programming, for example the selection of beneficiaries was based on their level of vulnerability, \nincluding: households that have lost their source of livelihoods (loss of crops and animals), the chronically ill, \nelderly, female-headed households, lactating mothers and under-five children (malnourished), pregnant \nwomen, and/or people with disabilities. The ERCS has been working closely with the Government, stakeholders \nand other agencies to ensure that there will be no duplication of interventions of activities.  \n \nOverall objective \nThe revised Emergency Appeal will assist 318,325 beneficiaries through the distribution of supplementary food, \nsupport to malnutrition screening and referral, community health services support, improved access to safe \nwater and hygiene promotion, and reinforcing family livelihoods and coping mechanisms. The supplementary \nP a g e  | 4 \n \n \nfood component in the revised Appeal targets families with children under five and pregnant and lactating \nmothers. \n \nCoordination and partnerships \nThe ERCS technical coordinators based in the headquarters Disaster Preparedness and Response Department \nparticipate in their respective clusters to allow for enhanced visibility of Red Cross Movement activities and \nensure coordination with non-Movement partners. The ERCS is part of the Drought Technical Working Group \norganised by the National Disaster Response Mission Commission (NDRMC) in Addis Ababa. At zonal and \nworeda3 level, the GoE has organised Drought Response Task Forces in which the ERCS branches participate. \n \nThe IFRC supports the ERCS through its East Africa and Indian Ocean Islands (EAIOI) Country Cluster Support \nTeam (CCST) and the Regional Office for Africa, which are both based in Nairobi, Kenya, and through an IFRC \nOperations Manager based in the ERCS headquarters in Addis Ababa. \n \nIn Ethiopia, the IFRC, ICRC and Partner National Societies (PNSs) participate in regular co-ordination meetings \nconvened by the ERCS. All issues including potential bilateral and multilateral actions are discussed. \nAdditionally, IFRC convenes regular co-ordination meetings in Nairobi with ICRC and PNS representatives to \nshare updates on the situation in Ethiopia and neighbouring countries, and Movement actions to date.  \n \nThere is an extensive PNS presence in Ethiopia, and all PNS\u2019s have different strategies to support the ERCS \ndrought emergency response. Discussion with the IFRC Country representative and the ERCS Secretary \nGeneral resulted in an agreement that all partners\u2019 drought response activities should be harmonised with the \nERCS National Drought Response Plan.  \n \nThe overall emergency response in Ethiopia is led by the NDRMC in close coordination with the Disaster Risk \nManagement Food Security Services (DRMFSS) of the Ministry of Agriculture. Sector task forces have been \nestablished at national, regional, zonal and woreda level with the participation of all stakeholders including the \nERCS. \n \nTo date, the GoE has allocated more than US$ 730 million to address critical humanitarian needs.  National \nand sub-national committees have been established to oversee the distribution of relief supplies, which include \nfood distributions, water point rehabilitation, livestock support, health services, and non-food items distribution \nfor the internally displaced families.  \n \nThe GoE, together with partners, has been able to respond to most of the increased health related needs \nattributed to drought. To maximise the response capacity, the GoE had divided the most affected woredas in \neach region amongst operational partners. With ongoing drought affecting mostly the southern and south \neastern areas, partners need to re-look at scaling up their operational presence in these areas and programme \nfocus to include emergency activities alongside their current development programmes. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n3 Woredas is the Ethiopian term for districts \nP a g e  | 5 \n \n

Click here for the interim financial report> \n \nSummary:  \n \nAccording to the Food Security Outlook Update - August 2016 published by the Famine Early Warning Systems Network \n(FEWSNET), rainfall is expected to increase, resulting in near-average national harvests for the Primera and Postrera \nseasons. There are reports of localized damage to staple crops in low-lying areas of eastern and western parts of the \ndry corridor due to the erratic distribution of rainfall and cumulative rainfall deficits for the season; however, the damage \nis less severe than last year. \n \nThe poorest households in the Western Temperate Highlands remained in crisis mode (IPC Phase 3) until October \n2016, when income-generating opportunities improved seasonally; their status has since been upgraded to \u201cStressed\u201d \n(IPC Phase 2) as of January 2017 because they now have food reserves from their December 2016 harvests at their \ndisposal. \n \nEmergency Appeal Operations Update  \nGuatemala: Food Insecurity and Drought \n \nP a g e  | 2 \n \n \n \n  \nAccording to the Institute of Seismology, Volcanology, Meteorology and Hydrology of Guatemala (INSIVUMEH), the \nwinter of 2015 was severely affected by the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon; satellite estimates indicated that the accumulated \nrainfall was the lowest in the last 35 years, especially in the region known as the Dry Corridor. \n \nThe drought affected households in the western region by reducing the production of basic grains, income and access \nto employment. In the particular case of Guatemala, 2016 was the third consecutive year in which small farmers were \naffected by the scarcity of rain. According to the reports issued by Action Against Hunger, 50 per cent of the rural \npopulation exhausted their mechanisms of survival in 2016, and by the end of the year, the Ministry of Agriculture, \nLivestock and Food reported that there were more than 110,000 food insecure families due to the drought. \n \nIn January 2016, Guatemala Red Cross carried out a detailed evaluation of families in the rural areas of the Chich\u00e9 and \nPatzite municipalities in the department of Quich\u00e9, which determined that all of the interviewed families experienced \nlosses of more than 50 per cent; in addition, more than 35 per cent of families were implementing survival strategies \nthat included the sale of livestock and physical assets. \n  \nA.2 Summary of measures taken by the National Society \n \n \nUnder the operation\u2019s framework, the National Society established 8 criteria for the selection of families and \ncommunities: \n\u2022 Families whose livelihood is 60 per cent1 dependent on maize sowing \n\u2022 households with partial or total loss of crops (beans and maize) \n\u2022 households with single mothers that are heads of household, \n\u2022 households with more than 7 family members,  \n\u2022 households with elderly members, \n\u2022 households with children under 5 and / or pregnant women, \n\u2022 households with persons with disabilities, \n\u2022 families of children with acute malnutrition \n \nBased on these criteria, the following communities were prioritized: \n\u2022 Choyomche 1 \n\u2022 Choyomche 2 \n\u2022 Choyomche 3 \n                                                     \n \n1 This percentage was determined by the assessment.  \nP a g e  | 3 \n \n\u2022 Carrizal \n\u2022 San Francisco \n\u2022 Laguna Seca 1 \n\u2022 Chuicojonop \n\u2022 Pachaj \n\u2022 Pazajcap \n \nThe selection criteria were used to provide the following aid and services to the affected families:  \n \nAREA OF INTERVENTION \nCHICH\u00c9 \nPATZIT\u00c9 \nTOTAL \nFOOD SECURITY, NUTRITION AND LIVELIHOODS \nFood distribution \n681 families \n319 families \n1,000 families \nStrengthening of livelihoods  \n0 \n360 families \n360 families \nDiversification of livelihoods \n0 \n0 \n0 \nGrowth monitoring  \n0 \n0 \n0 \nNutritional screening \n288 children \n212 children \n500 children \nEducational sessions for mothers \n600 mothers \n0 \n600 mothers \nHome visits \n30 families \n20 families \n50 families \nWATER, SANITATION AND HYGIENE PROMOTION  \nInstallation of rainwater harvesting systems  \n70 families \n0 \n70 families \nProtection of water sources and maintenance of \nwater systems \n4 communities \n0 \n4 communities \nParticipatory \nHygiene \nand \nSanitation \nTransformation (PHAST) \n600 mothers \n0 \n600 mothers \nC.

        "text": " \nDescription of the disaster \n \nPapua New Guinea has been experiencing a prolonged dry spell since May 2015 which is the consequence of \nchanging climatic conditions caused by El Nino. The country has experienced reduced rainfall in all regions and the \nseasonal rains expected in November are now not anticipated until the first half of 2016. The drought situation and its \nongoing impact remains largely unchanged despite some rain and distribution of food by the Government of PNG. \n \nVegetation Stress Index Aerial Maps reflect the situation, \nshowing that vegetation across north east part of PNG is under \nstress most notably in the Highlands, in Chimbu Province, \nWestern, Southern and Eastern Highlands as well as Morobe \nand East New Britain. The maps indicate that vegetation in \nlower altitude is under more stress compared to higher \naltitudes. \n \nThe majority of a portion of staple food crops (sweet potato \nand potato gardens), plants and trees are destroyed and \ncreeks and rivers are also drying up in the agricultural hub of \nthe Tambul Nembilyer district of Western Highlands Province. \nSome provincial markets have closed down, reduced quantity \nof produce, whilst prices increased - as reported in the affected \nareas of Tambul Nembilyer (Western Highlands) and Andareas \n(Southern Highlands).  There has been a spike in the price of \nproduce in the market in Mt Hagen, combined with a decrease \nin quantity and quality of produce available.  The main supply \nareas include most affected regions in Western Highlands, \nTambul Nembilyer and Highlands Central as well as Jiwaka. \nProduce is continuing to be exported to main centers, Port Moresby and Lae, where the demand and the market price \nis significantly higher than in Mt Hagen.  \n \nIt has been reported by the Western Highlands branch that some streams and rivers that were used as primary water \nsources have dried up. Populations in affected areas are resorting to secondary water sources (traditionally used for \nwashing and bathing) as drinking water and in food preparation. This increases the risk of diarrhoea and typhoid \nalready prevalent in PNG. However, the Ministry of Health has not confirmed increased cases or any outbreak to date.  \n \nAffected populations are coping using traditional mechanisms, including sharing of resources within tribes. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDREF Operation n\u00b0 MDRPG005 \nGlide n\u00b0 CW-2015-000116-PNG \nDREF operation update  n\u00b0 1 \nDate of issue: 30 October \nDate of disaster: 31 July 2015 \nOperation start date: 15 September 2015 \nOperation end date:  15 December 2015 \nOverall operation budget: CHF 150,669  \nNumber of people affected: estimated 2 million \nNumber of people to be assisted: 15,000 people \n(3,000 families) \n \n \n \nCommunity from Upper Nembilyer, Tambul  Nembilyer \ndistrict, with clothes in dried creek bed. \nPhoto: Freeman Manyavi, PNGRC \n \nDREF operation update \nPapua New Guinea:  Drought  \n \n | 2 \nP a g e\n \nPNG Red Cross volunteers during the participatory hygiene \ntraining.  Photo: Freeman Manyavi /PNGRC \nThere is an increased risk of fire, as traditionally land is cleared and rejuvenated by burning in some of the affected \nareas. A fire occurred in Henganofi, in Eastern Highlands, during week of Monday 28 September that spread with dry \nvegetables catching fire from wind. Preliminary PNG Red Cross assessments indicate that more than 25 houses were \ndestroyed. Local authorities are recommending restrictions to land clearing by fire during El Nino.  \n \n \nSummary of current response \n \nNational Society \nPapua \nNew \nGuinea \nRed \nCross \n(PNGRC) \nheadquarters representatives continue to participate \nin \ngovernment-led \ncoordination \nmeetings. \nThe \nNational Society is engaged in response planning and \nongoing dialogue with the International Federation of \nRed Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) in \nrelation to ongoing support needs. At the branch \nlevel, Western Highland branch has mobilized \nvolunteers and staff for participatory hygiene training \nsupported by the IFRC regional WASH delegate and \nlocal NGOs.  On 16 October, the interim secretary \ngeneral and disaster manager travelled to Mt Hagen \nto meet with branch representatives. The meeting \ndiscussions informed the broader national drought \nmanagement plan and the immediate Western \nHighlands assessment plan of action. It is likely that \nthe DREF plan of action and budget will be revised to \naccommodate these updated needs.  \n \n \nRed Cross Red Crescent Movement in country  \nThe IFRC country team comprising a WASH delegate and disaster management (DM) officer seconded from Solomon \nIslands Red Cross were mobilized to Mt Hagen, Western Highlands Province, supporting the local branch with \nhygiene promotion, assessment methodology and response planning. \n \nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) based in Port Moresby and Mt Hagen continue to support the \nIFRC country team and National Society with accommodation, logistics and security. Joint planning and collaboration \nbetween ICRC and IFRC and the Papua New Guinea Red Cross is ongoing. The Australian Red Cross (ARC) have \npledged assistance in the form of HR capacity and have offered to deploy a WASH advisor to the country in order to \nreplace the WASH delegate once her mission is completed. \n \nNon-Movement actors in country \nGovernment response  \nAt provincial level, the Provincial District Councils (PDC) continue to monitor the situations and have started small \nscale initial responses in some affected areas. The PDCs are updating the NDC regularly.  \n \nThe government\u2019s initial allocation of PGK 5 million (approximately CHF 1.69 million) was used for the deployment of \nfour multi-agency rapid assessment teams and the purchase of the first batch of food supplies for the most affected \ncommunities in the Highlands region. Another PGK 25 million (approximately CHF 8.46 million) has been committed \nby the government.  \n \nThe first phase of the Government response has been completed. The response includes food distribution to \ncommunities in Highlands, in provinces and districts that are in category 4 or 5. There are government plans to \npurchase and provide jerry cans to East New Britain for transport and storage of water. The second phase is expected \nto commence this month and ends in December with recovery expected from January to March 2016.  \n \nGovernment-led National Disaster Response Committee (NDRC) meetings are continuing to take place weekly. A \nhumanitarian assistance tracking form was circulated to all partners to indicate activities and locations to assist the \nGovernment of PNG in coordination.  \n \nCoordination in WASH sector continues with a subcommittee of the NDRC, newly established for the drought \nresponse. This will complement the WASH committee within the National Department of Health, which has a \ndevelopment focus. Coordination with other humanitarian agencies by PNGRC continues in Port Moresby.

        "text": " \nDescription of the disaster \n \nPapua New Guinea has been experiencing a prolonged dry spell since May 2015 which is the consequence of \nchanging climatic conditions caused by El Nino. The country has experienced reduced rainfall in all regions and the \nseasonal rains expected in November are now not anticipated until the first half of 2016. The drought situation and its \nongoing impact remains largely unchanged despite some rain and distribution of food by the Government of PNG. \n \nVegetation Stress Index Aerial Maps reflect the situation, \nshowing that vegetation across north east part of PNG is under \nstress most notably in the Highlands, in Chimbu Province, \nWestern, Southern and Eastern Highlands as well as Morobe \nand East New Britain. The maps indicate that vegetation in \nlower altitude is under more stress compared to higher \naltitudes. \n \nThe majority of a portion of staple food crops (sweet potato \nand potato gardens), plants and trees are destroyed and \ncreeks and rivers are also drying up in the agricultural hub of \nthe Tambul Nembilyer district of Western Highlands Province. \nSome provincial markets have closed down, reduced quantity \nof produce, whilst prices increased - as reported in the affected \nareas of Tambul Nembilyer (Western Highlands) and Andareas \n(Southern Highlands).  There has been a spike in the price of \nproduce in the market in Mt Hagen, combined with a decrease \nin quantity and quality of produce available.  The main supply \nareas include most affected regions in Western Highlands, \nTambul Nembilyer and Highlands Central as well as Jiwaka. \nProduce is continuing to be exported to main centers, Port Moresby and Lae, where the demand and the market price \nis significantly higher than in Mt Hagen.  \n \nIt has been reported by the Western Highlands branch that some streams and rivers that were used as primary water \nsources have dried up. Populations in affected areas are resorting to secondary water sources (traditionally used for \nwashing and bathing) as drinking water and in food preparation. This increases the risk of diarrhoea and typhoid \nalready prevalent in PNG. However, the Ministry of Health has not confirmed increased cases or any outbreak to date.  \n \nAffected populations are coping using traditional mechanisms, including sharing of resources within tribes. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDREF Operation n\u00b0 MDRPG005 \nGlide n\u00b0 CW-2015-000116-PNG \nDREF operation update  n\u00b0 1 \nDate of issue: 30 October \nDate of disaster: 31 July 2015 \nOperation start date: 15 September 2015 \nOperation end date:  15 December 2015 \nOverall operation budget: CHF 150,669  \nNumber of people affected: estimated 2 million \nNumber of people to be assisted: 15,000 people \n(3,000 families) \n \n \n \nCommunity from Upper Nembilyer, Tambul  Nembilyer \ndistrict, with clothes in dried creek bed. \nPhoto: Freeman Manyavi, PNGRC \n \nDREF operation update \nPapua New Guinea:  Drought  \n \n | 2 \nP a g e\n \nPNG Red Cross volunteers during the participatory hygiene \ntraining.

The Namibia Red Cross Society (NRCS) \nsubsequently launched an appeal to support the government call for emergency assistance and to provide \nassistance in four of the worst affected regions .Through the response operation, NRCS will  provide support by \ndelivering assistance in Water and Sanitation, Food Security, Nutrition and Livelihoods sectors. \n \nDuring the reporting period, NRCS has undertaken some significant steps in supporting the worst affected \npopulations, by forging partnerships, co-ordination, assessments and direct programme delivery. An in-depth \nneeds assessment of Water Sanitation and Hygiene was undertaken by the WASH cluster\u2019s Rapid Assessment \nteam in four regions and a detailed household food security needs assessment has been completed with the \nsupport of a British Red Cross Household Economic Security (HES) Analyst. This has provided important \ninformation and guidance on designing a needs based response.  \n \nTo date, cash  contributions have been received from the  American Red Cross, European Commission \u2013 DG \nECHO, Japanese Red Cross Society, Luxembourg Government, Red Cross of Monaco, Swedish Red Cross, \nThe Canadian Red Cross Society (from the Canadian Government), and The Netherlands Red Cross and \nUSAID. On behalf of Namibia Red Cross Society, IFRC would like to thank these donors for their generous \ncontributions to the Namibia Drought Emergency Appeal. \nEmergency appeal operation update \nNamibia: Drought \n\uf0b7 \nNamibia Red Cross volunteers serve lunch to 250 people, \nmainly children every day at the Red Cross branch in \nOpuwo, northern Namibia.

The government is drawing up a large scale response \nto distribute maize meal the implementation of which is just beginning. \n \nThe Red Cross has undertaken assessments on Food Security and WASH and the summary findings are as \nfollows;  \n \nFood Security Assessment: NRCS Staff and volunteers conducted a detailed HES assessment with the \ntechnical and financial support of British Red Cross between 10 July and 8 August, 2013 in the regions of \nKunene, Kavango and Oshikoto in northern Namibia that had previously been identified by the Government of \nthe Republic of Namibia (GRN) and the NRCS as being among the most drought-affected. The assessment \nfindings indicate significant differences between the situation and the populations\u2019 coping mechanisms in each \nof the three regions.  There are differences in terms of length of drought, the severity of the impact of drought, \nlivelihood strategy of the population, and the underlying level of poverty and coping strategies available to \nhouseholds. As a result of these differences, two regions- Kunene and Kavango have been identified as \nneeding immediate assistance. \n \nThe assessed communities in Oshikoto are also affected by the drought but the HES assessment found they \nare better able to cope because of a higher average household income, cheaper food, the presence of small \nlivestock (as saleable assets), and multiple sources of income and greater assistance from their community. In \nKunene and Kavango, many poor households lack regular income opportunities and assets. Households are \ntherefore increasingly reliant on government assistance in the form of pensions, grants and food assistance. In \nsome communities, households reported receiving donations of food from family and friends in 2012, which is \nan indication of the chronic poverty that some households are facing.  \n \nWater, Sanitation and Hygiene: On request from the Red Cross and UNICEF, a Rapid Assessment was \nconducted by the Inter-agency WASH Rapid Assessment team in four of the most affected of the 13 regions, \nnamely; Kavango, Kunene, Ohangwena and Oshikoto.The assessment found that in Kunene region, where a \nsubstantial proportion of households rely on livestock, the people are adversely affected by drought in terms of \nreduced pastures and water for both human and livestock consumption. In the other three regions of \nOhangwena, Kavango and Oshikoto, where households mainly rely on crop and partial livestock, the \nhouseholds food insecurity is due to crop failure, and partially to water resources for human consumption. \n \nMany communities are employing a variety of coping mechanism, including migrating to other areas in search of \ngrazing or water. Due to limited rainfall, families are resorting to consuming water from unprotected and \npotentially contaminated water sources, shared with animals. Some boreholes have dried up, and livestock \nfarmers have had to migrate further distances from their villages to find sufficient grazing rangeland, a situation \nthat might create a competition between communities over access to basic services, such as water, health and \neducation for children. \n \nAs the drought conditions intensify, community coping mechanisms are being eroded. This situation is likely to \nresult in over-use of limited resources such as water and grazing areas; loss of livelihood as livestock weakens \nor succumbs to effects of drought. This in turn has significant impact on health and wellbeing of the people \nmaking them susceptible to water and sanitation related diseases particularly, diarrhea and cholera.  \n \nFindings of both the WASH and Household Economic Security assessments have been shared widely and have \ninformed the Emergency Appeal, which is being revised to include a cash programme as recommended by the \nassessments. \n \nCoordination and partnerships \nThe NRCS continues to co-ordinate with all the stakeholders and the Government, both at national and regional \nlevels. The IFRC Sothern Africa Regional office is in regular contact with OCHA, DFID, USAID and EU in \nparticular to update them on the situation and to identify areas of collaboration. Other coordination measures \nremain the same as reported in the Emergency Appeal. \n \n \n3 \nRed Cross and Red Crescent action \n \nOverview \nSince the launch of the Emergency Appeal, the NRCS has undertaken a Household Economic Security (HES) \nAssessment and a Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Assessment (led by the WASH Cluster).  A British Red Cross HES \ndelegate supported the NRCS in July to assess the situation and coordinate with other agencies to undertake a food \nsecurity assessment and plan a response.  \n \nThe NRCS has started relief interventions including nutritional screening and referrals, provision of cooked meals to \nmalnourished children and other vulnerable, food-insecure people, and provision of knowledge and material support for \nsafe drinking water and hygiene.NRCS response so far per sector are as follows; \n \nFood Security: Eight soup kitchens have so far been established, 4 in Kunene region, 2 in Ohangwena and 2 in \nKavango region. The target beneficiaries include children under 5 years, orphans and vulnerable children (OVCs), \npeople with disabilities, pregnant and breast feeding women, elderly people who have no other support and HIV/AIDs \npatients who are under treatment. Beneficiaries are registered to monitor how many individuals are regularly eating at \neach soup kitchen, and then coded, using identification cards, to monitor the number of people accessing this support \nevery day to ensure consistency and coverage. Volunteers follow up with families who do not attend and they are \nencouraged to regularly participate in the feeding scheme. \n \nBased on the HES assessment a cash response has been planned to meet immediate household needs and will \nincluded in the revised appeal. A cash transfer programme concept note was developed and shared with the \nGovernment of Namibia. The details of operationalizing the cash programme are being designed. \n \nWater, Sanitation and Hygiene: A baseline survey has been conducted in Kunene and in Ohangwena region, water \npurification tablets have been distributed to 21,000 beneficiaries in 49 villages in Okongo constituency, while in \nOmundaungilo, water purification tablets were distributed to 500 beneficiaries. Volunteers have been trained in \ndistribution techniques and households have been identified in Ohangwena and Kavango regions for distribution of \nhygiene kits.  \n \nNutrition: Nutrition training on Infant and Young Child feeding for community volunteers has been conducted in \nKavango and Ohangwena regions. The training was attended by 40 volunteers in Kavango and 118 volunteers in \nOhangwena. Middle Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) measurements have so far been taken on 143 children in \nKavango and Ohangwena and 32 children have been identified as malnourished. These children have been \nsubsequently referred to both the health centres for treatment and to the Red Cross soup kitchens.  \n \nTwo Regional Disaster Response Team members (1 generalist and 1 WatSan were deployed to assist the National \nSociety. A cash transfer delegate has also been deployed from the British Red Cross HES roster to design and \nimplement the cash transfer programme. A full-time operations manager has been recruited and is supporting the \nNRCS to implement the response. \n \nProgress towards outcomes  \n \nFood security, nutrition and livelihoods \nOutcome 1: At least 2,000 Orphan and Vulnerable children, disabled and elderly people have \nimproved access to sufficient nutrition food in the targeted areas for up to six months \nOutputs (expected results) \nPlanned activities  \n\uf0b7 \nIntegrated \nneeds \nassessment \nand \nbaseline completed. \n\uf0b7 \nProvide cooked meals \nat the 4 regional soup \nkitchens to 2,000 of the \nmost \nvulnerable \nindividuals in the 4 \nregions for 6 months (2 \ntimes a day).   \n \n\uf0b7 \nDesigning of methodology and questionnaires for integrated \nWASH, Food Security and Nutrition assessment \n\uf0b7 \nHousehold Economy Security technical support \n\uf0b7 \n40 volunteers are trained to assist government for targeting and \nfood distribution (10 in each affected area) \n\uf0b7 \nSupport 2000 individuals (500 most vulnerable individuals each \nin the four regions).  \n\uf0b7 \nProcure cooking materials for each kitchen in each region. \nThese will include 2 big pots, one stove with two plates, 500 \nplates, 5 washing dishes and 500 spoons per region. \n\uf0b7 \nProcure foods items for soup kitchen (Maize meal 176.4 MT, \n \n4 \n\uf0b7 \nStrengthen \nand \nestablish a total of 4 \nkitchen \ngardens \nfor \nsupporting \nfeeding \nscheme \n \n4 regions = 4 kitchens \n= feeding 2,000 in total \n(500 per kitchen) \n \nBeans 3.15 MT, Fish 1.6 MT, Beef 1.6 MT, cooking oil 1.6 MT \nand vegetable 5.25 MT) \n\uf0b7 \nThe ratios were calculated using standard calculator. \n\uf0b7 \nTrain 40  volunteers (10 per region) in food preparation \n\uf0b7 \n10 volunteers cook and provide meals to beneficiaries per region \n\uf0b7 \nEstablish one community group (fifteen members per group) per \ngarden that will work on the gardens entailing beneficiaries of \nthe feeding schemes. If necessary, gardening activities will start \nNovember and December during rainfall season. The community \ngroups will also benefit from the tanks to be provided all though \nthe gardens will be next to river or water points. \n\uf0b7 \nGive one training and follow up support to each community \ngroups on gardening (soil preparation, compost making, \nplanting, pest and diseases control, watering and harvesting) \n\uf0b7 \nProcure vegetable seeds for the gardens (including Cabbages, \nTomatoes, Lettuce, Rape, Carrot, Beetroots, Spinach, Onion \nand Green peppers), 350 kg per community group. \n\uf0b7 \nProcure tools that will be used in the gardens (8 watering cans, 8 \ndigging forks, 8 rakes, 3 spraying cans, 5 spades, 3 \nwheelbarrows, 15 gloves, 2 generators, 4 roles of steel wires, 2 \nroles of soft wires, 2 roles of diamond wire, 56 poles, 2 gates, 25 \ncement, 4 black pipes, 4 tanks and tank stands each garden) \n\uf0b7 \nProcure other gardening inputs such fertilizers and weed killers  \n\uf0b7 \nSupport soil preparation, planting, weeding, disease and pest \ncontrol and harvesting by NRCS volunteers and Government \nextension workers \n \nProgress: A Household Economic Security Assessment has been completed. Eight soup kitchens have so \nfar been established, four in Kunene region, two in Ohangwena and two in Kavango region. The target \nbeneficiaries include children under the age of five years, orphans and other vulnerable children (OVCs), \ndisabled people, pregnant and breast feeding mothers, elderly people who have no support and HIV/AIDs \npatients who are under treatment. Beneficiaries are registered to monitor how many individuals are regularly \neating at each soup kitchen station, and then coded, using identification cards, to identify who has turned up \nfor a meal every day. This enables both the consistency and coverage of the programme to be monitored. \n \nOutcome 2: At least 80 per cent of under 5 children have access to community based nutrition and \nduring the drought emergency in four northern regions of Namibia \nOutputs (expected results) \nActivities planned \n\uf0b7 \n80% \nof \nhouseholds \nwith \nmothers \nand \ncaregivers of children \nunder 5 years of age \nreceive \nnutrition \neducation \nand \ncounseling and hygiene \npromotion  \n\uf0b7 \n100% of children under \n5 years from the  target \nregions, identified as \nbeing \nseverely \nmalnourished \nare \nreferred \nto \nhealth \nfacility \nservices \nfor \nmanagement \nand \ntreatment \n\uf0b7 \nCommunity demand for \nmaternal, \ninfant \nand \nyoung child nutrition  \n\uf0b7 \nConduct a minimum of two TOTs in C-IYCF, acute malnutrition \nscreening and WASH hygiene promotion (PHAST) for 350 \nvolunteers \n\uf0b7 \nCascade C-IYCF, acute malnutrition screening and hygiene \npromotion to health volunteers in Kavango, Ohangwena, \nOshikoto and Kunene regions.

The IFRC SARO communications officer took an Al Jazeera web \njournalist to the field during the first week of September to visit the worst drought hit regions of Namibia. To \ndate interviews with IFRC field staff and with the Regional Representative have been published. Coverage \nfrom Al Jazeera is also expected to include further stories and photojournalism. Facebook, Twitter and \nInstagram posts reached hundreds of thousands of viewers and continue to be shared online.  Domestically, \nthe Namibia Red Cross features in local news media almost on a daily basis.

The DREF is a vital \npart of the International Federation\u2019s disaster response system and increases the ability of National \nSocieties to respond to disasters. \nSummary: 332,099 Swiss francs have \nbeen \nallocated \nfrom \nthe \nIFRC\u2019s \nDisaster \nRelief \nEmergency \nFund \n(DREF) to support the Paraguayan Red \nCross (PRC) in delivering immediate \nassistance to some 2,500 families (an \nestimated \n12,500 \npersons). \nThe  \noperation \nclosed \nwith \na \ntotal \nexpenditure of 327,863 Swiss francs, \nwith a final balance of 4,236 Swiss \nfrancs unspent and returned to the \nDREF fund. \n \nWith severe droughts affecting several \ndepartments in Paraguay and causing the \nloss of crops, particularly for small \nproducers, the National Society worked \nalongside governmental authorities to \nassist families. With the support of the \nDREF, the National Society was able to \nreach 3,400 families, 900 more than the \noriginal target, with one food parcel and one seed kit. These distributions were accompanied by \ncommunity trainings and technical support provided by an agronomist hired as a consultant.

Whilst certain areas experienced heavy rainfall, some areas of Paraguay experienced drought, with \naccumulated precipitation far below historical averages. Some areas, such as the San Juan Bautista district \nin the department of Misiones had 0mm of rain in December, while the historical average (based on the last \n10 years) is of 168mm. Similarly, the district of Mar\u00eda Auxiliadora, in the department of Caaguaz\u00fa, received \n4.1mm compared to the historical average of 154mm.  \n \nThe area affected by the drought is one of the most important agricultural regions in Paraguay. The Risk \nManagement Unit of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (Ministerio de Agricultura y Ganader\u00eda - MAG) \nindicated that some 263,800 families suffered losses in their crops, of which almost 200,000 families were \nsmall producers (with less than 10 hectares of land). The most affected food crops were those of corn (58 \nper cent loss), beans (47 per cent), and manioc (39 per cent). However, the Paraguayan agribusiness also \nsuffered significant losses, particularly of the soy and sesame crops with  56 per cent  34 per cent loss of \ncrops respectively. The most affected departments, in terms of food crops, were Itap\u00faa, Paraguar\u00ed, Alto \nParan\u00e1, and Canindey\u00fa.  \n \nRed Cros s  and Red Cres cent action \n \nThe Paraguayan Red Cross is an active member of the National Emergency Secretariat (Secretar\u00eda de \nEmergencia Nacional, SEN), and as such was called on to support the humanitarian response to the \ndroughts suffered in many regions of Paraguay. To fulfill its auxiliary role, the National Society worked in \nclose partnership with the MAG and departmental and local authorities, supporting the activation of the \nEmergency Operation Centres (EOC), the distribution of relief items and the sharing of vital information, \nincluding a copy of the new Minimum Standards in Disaster Response (Sphere) Manual to guide the \nintegrated response to the emergency. \n \nWith the collaboration of the IFRC\u2019s DREF, Partner National Societies, the Spanish Agency for International \nDevelopment Cooperation (Agencia Espa\u00f1ola de Cooperaci\u00f3n Internacional para el Desarrollo, AECID) and \nthe Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the Paraguayan Red Cross was able to reach 8,158 families \nfrom the departments of Canindey\u00fa, Concepci\u00f3n, San Pedro, and \u00d1eembuc\u00fa.  \n  \nDepartment \nNo. of \nMunicipalities \nNo. of \ncommunities \nNo. of families \nreached \nPartner \nCanindey\u00fa \n4 \n74 \n3,400 \nIFRC-DREF \nConcepci\u00f3n \n3 \n24 \n1,026 \nSwiss Red Cross  \nSan Pedro \n1 \n6 \n520 \nAmerican Red \nCross \n\u00d1eembuc\u00fa \n9 \n76 \n3,212 \nIDB/Spanish Red \nCross - AECID \nTotal \n17 \n180 \n8,158 \n \n \n \nAchievements  agains t outcomes  \n \nFood security and livelihoods  \nOutcome: Assist 2,500 of the most vulnerable farmer families in the department of Canindey\u00fa with \nhumanitarian aid consisting of supplementary food items and seed kits. \nOutput 1: 2,500 families receive one food parcel of 34kg to complement their diet for one month \nOutput 2: 2,500 families receive one seed kit and training to support the planting of one hectare of \nland. \n \nActivities planned:  \n\u2022 \nComplete more detailed damage and needs assessments on selected districts, with support of an \nagronomist.  \n\u2022 \nCoordinate with governmental authorities, at the national and municipal level. \n3 \n \n\u2022 \nCoordinate with community leaders.  \n\u2022 \nDevelop a beneficiary targeting strategy and registration system to deliver intended assistance. \n\u2022 \nSelect suppliers. \n\u2022 \nDistribute food parcels and seed kit to small farmers.  \n\u2022 \nProvide technical assistance to affected families (to be conducted by the agronomist). \n\u2022 \nMonitor and evaluate the relief activities and provide reporting on relief distributions. \n \n \nImpact: Originally, the PRC selected 2,500 families to reach with food items and seed kits to support their \nrecovery of lost crops based on the preliminary information gathered by MAG as the emergency was \ndeclared. However, to ensure that the most vulnerable families would be reached by their assistance, the \nNational Society deployed four damage and needs assessment teams to \u00d1eembuc\u00fa, Concepci\u00f3n, San \nPedro, and Canindey\u00fa in coordination with the MAG and SEN to analyse the situation of affected families. \nAfter these new assessments, the PRC selected 3,400 families to reach with DREF support, 900 families \nmore than originally estimated. In addition, 4,758 families were reached with support from other partners \nsuch as the American Red Cross, Spanish Red Cross, Swiss Red Cross, AECID, and the IDB.   \n \nThe PRC assisted small farmers (with less than 10 hectares of land), with priority given to vulnerable groups \nsuch as indigenous families. The decision of which families to reach was made on the basis of previous \nexperiences working in the area, level of vulnerability to different types of emergencies, the level of contact \nof the National Society\u2019s branches with their communities, and other socio-economic parameters such as \nmaterials of homes and services present in the communities. However, in the case of the Canindey\u00fa \ndepartment, where the PRC does not have a branch, the region was selected as a result of the presence of \nindigenous communities with great need of assistance. The table below illustrates the families reached with \nthe support of the DREF in the districts of Curuguaty, Villa Ygatim\u00ed, Corpus Christi, and Yasy Ka\u00f1y, all in \nCanindey\u00fa department. All these families were reached with one food parcel (as the Paraguayan \ngovernment provided parcels for an additional two months) and one seed kit (see annex for details on \nfamilies\u2019 location).  \n \nDistricts \n(Canindey\u00fa department) \nNo. of families \ntargeted after 2nd \nassessment1 \nNo. of \nfamilies \nreached \n% \nreached \nCuruguaty \n1,463 \n1,511 \n103.3 \nVilla Ygatim\u00ed \n887 \n862 \n97.2 \nCorpus Christi \n954 \n933 \n97.8 \nYasy Ka\u00f1y \n96 \n94 \n97.9 \nTotal \n3,400 \n3,400 \n100 \n \nBecause the families selected are small farmers dependent on subsistence crops that were lost during the \ndrought (with losses of about 47 per cent of manioc, 51 per cent of corn, and 28 per cent of beans), the \nNational Society supported the government strategy of reaching affected families first with food parcels to \nsupport their immediate food security needs, and then with seed kits of fast growing plants.  \n \nAs all actions were coordinated by the government, the National Society shared the contents of its standard \nfood parcel. After analyzing the contents and cost of the parcel suggested by the PRC, the government \ndecided to modify it and reduce it to a packet of approximately 34kg (730 kilocalories) as most families had \naccess to other food sources, particularly those of animal origins. During an EOC meeting, all organizations \nagreed to distribute this standard parcel across the country to avoid conflicts between communities or \ndepartments. For contents of the food parcel distributed please refer to the DREF Bulletin. Similarly, the \ncontents of the seed kit were chosen by technical experts from MAG to support the cultivation of one hectare \nof land with beans, corn and other vegetables.  \n \nIt should be noted that the National Society was able to reach 3,400 families, 136 per cent  more than \noriginally intended, after obtaining better quotations in the local market. The majority of distributions (72 \ncommunities) were conducted between 23 to 28 February 2012, while the remaining families (4 \ncommunities) were reached between 10 and 11 March 2012. \n \n                                                 \n1 As stated in the plan of action, the National Society planned to reach 2,500 families originally, but after identifying an increase of \nneeds with the second assessment, the target was raised to 3,400 families.  \n4 \n \nAs intended, the PRC complemented the distributions of seed with technical assistance, provided by an \nagronomist hired to give trainings to the community.The agronomist worked in close partnership with the \nmembers of MAG to ensure that long term monitoring could be carried out after the closure of the DREF-\nsupported operation. The following topics were covered: \n \n1.  Nutrition: \n\u2022 \nImprovement of family\u2019s nutrition \n2. Vegetable gardens \n\u2022 \nWhat is a vegetable garden? \n\u2022 \nHow will it be done? \n\u2022 \nSteps to follow while creating a vegetable garden \n\u2022 \nWhat will be planted? \n\u2022 \nWhere will it be located? \n\u2022 \nSignificance of setting up a vegetable garden on a farm \n3.

Additional visits were completed after distributions to \nmonitor the planting of the seeds and ensure that technical assistance could be provided if needed.  \n \nIn addition to the above mentioned activities, the PRC was able to hire temporary National Society staff \nthrough this DREF supported operation, in order to have additional assistance available that assured the \nsuccess of the operation.   \n \n \n \nContact information \nFor further information specifically related to this operation please contact: \n\u2022 \nParaguayan Red Cross: Luis D\u00edaz de Bedoya, president of the Paraguayan Red Cross, phone: \n59521.222.797; email: crppcia@uninet.com.py \n\u2022 \nIFRC regional representation: Gustavo Ramirez, regional representative for the Southern Cone \nand Brazil; phone: +541.1495.17420; email: gustavo.ramirez@ifrc.org:  \n\u2022 \nIFRC Americas zone office: Benoit Porte, acting Pan American Disaster Response Unit (PADRU) \ncoordinator; phone: + 507.317.3050; email: benoit.porte@ifrc.org. \n \n\u2022 \nIn \nGeneva: \nChristine \nSouth, \nOperations \nSupport, \nPhone: \n+41.22.730.4529, \nemail: \nchristine.south@ifrc.org \nFor Performance and Accountability  \n(planning, monitoring, evaluation and reporting enquiries)  \n\u2022 \nIn the Americas zone office: Jane Grimshaw, PMER manager; phone: +507.317.3050; email: \njane.grimshaw@ifrc.org   \n \n \nDREF his tory: \n\u2022 \nThis DREF was initially allocated on 27 January 2012 for CHF 332,099 for three months to assist \n2,500 families. \n5 \n \n \n\uf0e6\uf020\nClick here \n1.

The consignment for Puntland arrived in Bosaso port on 10 December, \n2011. The distribution for the IDP settlements in the three regions of Bari, Mudug and Nugal is expected to be \ncompleted by end of December. The five Land Cruiser vehicles for use by the mobile health teams have arrived in \nBerbera port in Somaliland on 6 December and will replace the current rented vehicles. Delivery to the SRCS \nbranches is expected to be completed by 13 December.  \n \nThe SRCS branches in Puntland (Galkayo, Bosaso and Garowe) received 1,000 ceramic water filters to be \ndistributed to the IDP households. The SRCS branches in Somaliland and Puntland procured and delivered food \nrations for 9 schools in Somaliland and 5 in Puntland.  \n \nThe mobile health teams continued to deliver services to the IDPs and nomadic communities in remote areas. \nDuring the month of November, the 14 mobile teams reached 22,510 beneficiaries. These included 11,672 \noutpatient consultations, 2,251 antenatal consultations and 1,170 postnatal consultations. Additionally, 4,191 \nchildren were screened for growth monitoring, 972 children vaccinated, and 2,254 women received Tetanus Toxiod \nvaccine. \n \n2\nThe situation \nDue to concerted efforts by the humanitarian agencies to scale up activities in southern Somalia three regions, \nBay, Bakool and Lower Shabelle have been downgraded from famine situation to humanitarian emergency. \nHowever, there are 250,000 people still at risk of starvation. Access in the southern regions continued to be \nconstrained by the on-going military operations hampering the relief supplies to many people in critical need. Most \nof the regions of Somalia received average to above average rains with good coverage and distribution, \nreplenishing water points and improving pasture for livestock.  \n \nCoordination and partnerships \nThe SRCS continued to chair the weekly Movement coordination meeting in Mogadishu where information on \nhumanitarian activities is shared between the Movement partners. The SRCS supported by the ICRC and the \nFederation is working on a memorandum of understanding to be signed by the movement partners to improve \ncoordination and harmonization of activities. The SRCS and IFRC are working closely with the UN agencies and \nother humanitarian actors through the relevant clusters such as health and WASH under the umbrella of Somalia \nSupport Secretariat (SSS) and OCHA. \n \nNational Society Capacity Building:  \nThe IFRC Somalia Representation completed the procurement of 10 desk top computers, printers and \naccessories which will be delivered to the SRCS Coordination office in Mogadishu during the month of December. \nThe equipment will be used to train the SRCS staff youth and volunteers to improve their computer skills.   \n \nRed Cross and Red Crescent action \nThe SRCS branches in Somaliland completed the distribution of non-food items to 1,650 households in IDPs \nsettlements of the six regions of Somaliland. The consignment for Puntland which was shipped from Sharja Creek \nin UAE arrived Bosaso port on 10 December. The SRCS branch in Bosaso is working on the clearance of the \nconsignment. The SRCS branches in Bosaso, Garowe and Galkayo prepared the plans to distribute the items as \nsoon as they are cleared and transported to the respective destinations. The rehabilitation of water points is on-\ngoing. The SRCS branches in Garowe and Bosaso are working with the local communities to improve the water \nstorage facilities and protection of the earth dams known locally as \u201cBerkerts\u201d.

The \nappeal was later included in the International \nFederation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent \nSocieties\u2019 (IFRC\u2019s) Horn of Africa Appeal.  \n\u2022 \nA Preliminary Emergency Appeal was launched on 18 September 2009 for CHF 8,680,692 (USD \n8,427,856 or EUR 5,748,803) to support the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS) to assist 1,692,428 \nbeneficiaries for 6 months up to the end of March, 2010. \n\u2022 \nCHF 500,000 (USD 475, 285 or EUR 348,189 was allocated from the IFRC\u2019s Disaster Relief \nEmergency Fund (DREF) to kick start response activities. An amount of CHF 2,056,046 was pledged \ntowards the appeal. In addition to the activities implemented and reported in programme updates one \nand two the emergency needs were revised downwards due to an improvement in the food situation. \nThe appeal budget was downscaled from CHF 8,680,692 to CHF 2,056,046. The appeal revision was \nnot only driven by improvements in rainfall but also by the shift from emergency relief to recovery \noperations. This phase aimed to enable communities to achieve early recovery in food production, \nlivestock, water supply and sanitation, basic health care and capacity building activities. The recovery \nphase requires a longer implementation timeframe.  \n\u2022 \nA Revised Emergency Appeal was launched on 19 April 2010 for CHF 2,056,046 to support KRCS in \nassisting 293,000 people for a period of 12 months until the end of April 2011. A final report will be \nmade available by the end of July 2011 (three months after the end of the operation).  \n \nSummary: To ensure early recovery and increased resilience of communities affected by the drought, \nKRCS distributed a total of 200 MT of seeds to 20,000 farming households in Yatta, Mwingi, Makueni, \nMachakos and Kitui districts in the Lower Eastern Region. The seeds distribution took advantage of and \ncapitalised on the favourable rains experienced in most parts of the country in the latter part of 2009. KRCS \nwas also actively involved in resource mobilization and raising community awareness on the drought \nsituation to ensure effective implementation of activities under the emergency operation.  \n \n \nA green house farmer with KRCS volunteer in \nLower Eastern Region: Photo KRCS\n \n2 \n \nThe IFRC East Africa Regional Representation office continues providing technical support to the National \nSociety in the form of resource mobilisation, implementation of activities, training, logistic and reporting. The \nNational Society also collaborates with local and international organisation and partners Red Cross Red \nCrescent Movement components to ensure food security among population at risk. \n \nThe situation \nAn estimated ten million Kenyans countrywide faced starvation as a result of severe food shortages, which \nprompted the Government of Kenya to declare a national disaster on 16 January 2009. The affected \npopulation segments included 3.2 million people located in drought prone provinces, 1.5 million children \nunder the school feeding programmes, 2.5 million vulnerable Kenyans affected by various health and social \nissues including HIV and AIDS, orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) and another 2.5 million persons \nunder the category of urban poor. Many households had eroded their coping strategies and were heavily \nindebted with few alternative income generating options. The food shortage was as a result of the failure of \nfive consecutive rainfall seasons, the post election violence that affected the most agriculturally productive \nregions, an unprecedented rise in food and fertilizer prices and high inflation in the country causing a \nreduction in people\u2019s purchasing power.  \n \nAssessments carried out by KRCS in the affected regions indicated that population movement amongst \npastoral communities were at an all time high as they moved in search of pasture and water for their \nlivestock. In spite of this, very high rates of livestock deaths were recorded across the country further \ncrippling the purchasing capacities of many communities. Carcasses of sheep and other milking herds could \nbe seen strewn over long distances in Mandera, Wajir and Garrissa. The migrations also led to an escalation \nof conflicts and tensions between communities that enjoyed a fragile peace e.g. Pokot/Turkana, Kenyan \npastoralists and Ugandan/Somali pastoralists as they competed for the same depleted resources. At least 32 \ndeaths were reported following conflicts in Samburu and Laikipia.  \n \nThe prolonged drought resulted in the drying up of many water sources in the affected areas i.e. seasonal \nrivers, boreholes water pans etc. An exponential increase in the travel distances1 covered by most \ncommunities in search of clean water was reported in many areas especially in the Upper Eastern regions. \nThe inevitable consumption of contaminated water coupled by poor storage practices resulted in a severe \ncholera outbreak during the reporting period. In addition, malnutrition rates escalated in many areas for \nexample these rates stood at 15.8 per cent in Pokot Central, 11 per cent in Pokot North and 11.6 per cent in \nPokot Central. Cases of pellagra2 were reported amongst residents of Kibwezi and Makindu. School \nenrolment rates dropped in many areas as children moved with parents in search of water and pasture.    \n \nKRCS and the World Food Programme (WFP) intervened by providing relief food. The National Society \nrecognised the need to empower the communities and therefore it distributed seeds to farmers, which \nresulted in a bumper harvest in Yatta and Mwingi districts in Lower Eastern Region. \n \nThe KRCS also had a vision to increase food production and wealth creation to ensure communities became \nself sufficient. The National Society worked with Amiran Kenya Ltd, to improve food security, livelihoods and \nsustainability for small scale farmers. This project was implemented in the following areas, Tana River, Yatta \nand Matuu districts in Lower Eastern Region, Mandera, Wajir and Garrissa districts in North Eastern.  \n \nTana River Region \nAccording to the Kenya Food Security Steering Group (KFSSG), the Tana River Region is known to be food \ninsecure. The communities in this area are mainly agro-pastoralists. Due to the rains that extended to 2010, \nthe area has been classified as borderline food insecure as compared to acute food and livelihood crisis. The \ntrend is however expected to change as a result of the April to June rains, which have facilitated improved \nlivestock conditions and availability of water.  \n \nThe onset of the short rains was timely but resulted in heavy flooding, which destroyed crops in the Lower \nTana Delta destroying 121 hectares of the maize and rice crop along the Tana River. This did not result in a \ntotal loss of production as the remaining crop managed to produce an unexpected yield of 90kgs per hectare \nof maize due to the use of certified seeds. \n \n                                                 \n1 Severe water scarcity was reported in five districts and distances to water sources ranged from 30km to more than 100km \n2 Pellagra is a vitamin B3 deficiency disease caused by alterations in protein metabolism disorders.  \n \n3 \n \nLivestock production did not suffer much due to the proximity of water sources that resulted in a 25 percent \nincrease in milk production. The water sources were replenished as a result of the short rains experienced \ntowards the end of 2009 resulting in an increase in average water consumption from 15 to 25 litres per \nperson per day. Water contamination was exacerbated by a lack of latrines in most households resulting in \nan upsurge in diarrhoea related cases especially in children.  \n \nThe overall health situation of children less than five years of age as measured by the mid upper arm \ncircumference (MUAC) measurement showed an improvement though there were relatively high rates of \nmalnutrition. This was due to high milk intake in children without the intake of other nutrients. To curb this, a \nnutrition intervention was initiated focussing on improved dietary diversity.    \n \nCoast Region \nThis region comprises of four administrative districts namely, Malindi, Kilifi, Taita, Taveta and Kwale. The \nmain occupation of communities in this region is mixed farming which is practiced by 60 percent of the \nhouseholds. Crop and livestock production are the principal sources of income accounting for 30 percent to \n40 percent of household income respectively. The KFSSG attributes the cause of food insecurity in the Coast \nregion to lack of diversified agricultural production, poor agronomic practices and widespread human-wildlife \nconflict. After the short rains experienced at the end of 2009, the Coast Region recorded a marked \nimprovement in food security. Household food security continues to improve as expected crop yields are \nachieved and livestock productivity continues to be strengthened. \n \nDuring the rainy season, flash floods were experienced in Malindi, Kwale, Taita and Taveta districts which \nresulted in loss of lives, livestock and infrastructure. The region experienced high yields of 30 percent above \nthe average for the last five years as a result of the short rains. Livestock production in Taita Taveta, Kilifi \nand Kwale districts has improved remarkably and the travel distance to water sources has also reduced from \nten to three kilometres as a result of the rains. \n \nLower Eastern Region \nAccording to the KFSSG, the predominant livelihoods for the communities in this region are mixed farming. \nCrop production contributes 40 percent of household income. Food security in the region is hampered by \npoorly organised agricultural systems, poor post harvest management, unreliable rains, poor road networks \nand limited crop diversification. \n \nThe food security situation in this region has significantly improved from acute food and livelihood crisis \ncategory to generally food secure resulting from a bumper harvest, improved pasture and ample availability \nof water. The positive impact of the short rains is expected to be sustained if the long rains are normal. \nHowever, in some parts, the gains are likely to be moderated by the rapidly declining commodity prices \ncoupled with high post harvest losses due to poor storage, off-season rain-induced spoilage and the real \nthreat of aflatoxin contamination of the maize crop in some parts of the region. \n \nThe long rains have replenished all the major water sources in the region with temporal water sources \nrecording 50 to 75 percent capacity and expected to last longer than usual through to the next rainy season. \nThe average distance to water sources has reduced and water consumption has increased tremendously to \nbetween 15 to 30 litres per person per day compared to the average of 15 to 20 litres per person per day. \nThe exception was in Mbeere District, where consumption averaged 10 to 15 litres per person per day. The \nquality of water consumed also ranged from fair to good in most areas.  \n \nNorth Rift Region  \nThe main factors affecting food security in the North Rift Region are civil insecurity and livestock rustling \nparticularly in Samburu, Turkana and Marsabit. This is exacerbated by widespread land degradation, a \ndilapidated road network, slow recovery from frequent and lengthy droughts and poor market integration, \nwhich affects efficient pricing and food access.  \n \nAccording to the KFSSG, the food security situation in the northern pastoral livelihood cluster districts\u2019 \nimproved from acute food and livelihood crisis category recorded during the 2009 long rains assessment to \nborderline food insecure following the good short rains experienced towards the end of 2009. Substantially \nenhanced environmental fundamentals have contributed to an improvement in livestock conditions and \nproductivity, which has translated into improved milk availability for households, efficient livestock pricing and \nreduced conflict over resources.  \n \n \n4 \n \nThe total area under maize production within the region during the short rains season was 1,095 hectares, \nabout 50 percent of the average. Generally, the poor rains resulted in a poor harvest of 1,720 bags of maize \ncompared to a five-year average production of 61,030 bags. Low usage of certified seeds and fertilizer, \naveraging only ten percent, high temperatures that prevailed during most of the season coupled with low \nadoption of appropriate agronomic practices such as pests and disease control, are the main factors that \ncontributed to low crop output.  \n \nImproved trends are likely to be sustained over the next six months due to the availability of pasture and \nwater essential for livestock production. The unexpected rains in January and February 2010 strengthened \ngains achieved so far and the 2010 long rains should consolidate further the recovery process. However, \nrecovery in Central Turkana and parts of Marsabit district is expected to be slow due to a reduction in \nlivestock numbers as a result of the losses experienced during the past drought seasons, coupled with \nsustained high food prices, extensively degraded rangelands and the heavy floods experienced in the areas. \n  \nThe long rains have replenished most of the water sources within the region and about 50 percent of water \nsources in Moyale, 65 percent in Turkana, 98 percent in Marsabit and 100 percent in Samburu are currently \nholding water. However, the quality of water is generally poor because it is sourced mainly from semi-\nprotected or unprotected sources. The latrine coverage is generally low and is the main contributor to the \nhigh incidence of water borne diseases. \n \nUpper Eastern Region \nCommunities in this region are engaged in mixed farming, agro-pastoral farming, formal employment and \nirrigation. Food and cash crop production is a major contributor to household income. This region is classified \nas borderline food insecure except for localised pastoral areas in Laikipia and the mixed farming zone in \nNarok, which are classified as generally food secure. \n \nThe main factors affecting food security within the region are civil insecurity and livestock rustling, especially \nin West Pokot, Laikipia and Baringo, widespread land degradation, a poor road network and sustained high \nfood prices.  \n \nDue to the long rains, the food security situation in the region has generally improved. Crop production has \nimproved as a result of the rains which have replenished the water sources. The off-season showers \nexperienced up to February and the anticipated normal to above normal long rains are expected to sustain \nthe gains achieved so far. The food security situation at the household level is expected to continue \nimproving over the next six months. However, incidences of insecurity and high food prices will continue to \nimpede significant improvements to food security especially in parts of West Pokot, Baringo and Laikipia. \n \nThe long rains have had a significant impact on the crop harvest because of the flash floods which swept \naway crops on farms. The harvest has been low in the areas prone to floods but in areas like Kajiado and \nLoitotok, crop yields doubled from the normal 15 bags per hectare. Water sources have been replenished in \nKajiado and Narok. Similarly, about 75 percent of the pans in Laikipia and Baringo have also been \nreplenished. Thus water will be available through to the long rains.  \n \nCentral Region  \nThe 2010 long rains have been favourable across the Central Region and they have been largely consistent. \nThe rains have raised hopes of food security among marginal agricultural farm households that had suffered \nup to five poor or failed seasons prior to the 2009 short rains season. Although all indications are that the \nfood security crisis is improving, livelihoods remain fragile. Additional good rains are required to restore the \nresilience of livelihoods because significant numbers of livestock were lost to drought and disease. The \npurchasing capacities of households were eroded by sustained high food prices from 2008 through to \nFebruary 2010. Ironically the same households are now struggling to recover after the rapid decline in \nproducer prices resulting from the post\u2010harvest glut. \n \nCoordination and partnerships \nThe KRCS maintains strong collaboration and networking with donors, government line ministries, District \nSteering Groups (DSG) and other stakeholders in carrying out interventions under this emergency operation. \nThe KRCS continues to mobilise resources and carry out interventions with guidance of the IFRC East Africa \nRegional Representation Office in collaboration with the ICRC and the Partner National Societies. \n \n \n5 \n \nThe National Society, in partnership with Amiran Kenya Ltd and government officials continue to provide \ntraining on productive farming techniques and green houses in the arid and semi-arid areas as well as water \ninstallation systems to assist in irrigation in various parts of the country. Over 13 districts have benefited from \nthe Amiran Green House Project.  \n \nRed Cross and Red Crescent action \n \nThe KRCS has formed a partnership with \nAmiran Kenya Ltd to promote livelihoods \nand food security in the country. The \nproject is a drought recovery strategy \nthat is being implemented in Lower \nEastern, Tana River and North Eastern \nregions respectively. \n \nThe project will benefit from irrigation \ninputs such as irrigation equipment, \nseeds and fertilizers, livestock, modern \nbee-hives and water and sanitation \nfacilities. The project also aims to train \nthe targeted beneficiaries on agricultural \nbest \npractices, \noperation \nand \nmaintenance of equipment provided and \nhygiene \npromotion. \nThis \nwill \nbuild \ncapacity of the beneficiaries and the \ncommunity at large.  \n \n \nTana River \nThe Tana River livelihood project began in April 2010 and it is expected to end on 31 December 2010. The \nproject intends to contribute to drought recovery and climate change adaptation in Tana North District, Coast \nProvince. The KRCS has identified 20 irrigation groups and eight farmer groups in Madogo, Sala and Saka \nlocations. The groups have been registered and their proposals for assistance have been verified and \naccepted. Selected groups will be trained and provided with seeds and fertilizers. Coordination by the KRCS, \nthe local administration and government line ministries, has been instrumental in facilitating of training and \nmonitoring of on-going activities.  \n \nLower Eastern Region \nThis region has suffered from severe drought in six consecutive years. The region has therefore been relying \non relief assistance for livelihood. The KRCS supported its first intervention in the region as a proactive \nmeasure, through the distribution of certified seeds to the farmers in the region to empower communities and \nprovide food security. This resulted in a bumper harvest. \n \nThe second initiative was to introduce farmers to the Amiran farmer\u2019s kit to boost food production and wealth \ncreation in the region. The Amiran farmer\u2019s kit will facilitate production of high value crops and offer an \nenvironment for sustainable agro-business income. The livelihood project has so far trained 28 schools in \ngreenhouse technology as well as in the use of the Amiran kits. The schools have also received the Amiran \nkits and are currently implementing the new techniques. \n \nNorth Eastern \nThe project has resulted in the installation of 12 green houses in Mandera, Wajir and Garissa. In some farms \nsuch as Borehole 11 and Katulo in Mandera District, crops have been planted. Four farms have been \ncultivated while the rest are under preparation and manure treatment. \nA total of 36 people were trained on the Amiran Green House Drip Irrigation Programme. The participants \nwere able to benefit from practical work which enabled them to understand the greenhouse farming \ntechniques. The KRCS and Amiran Kenya Ltd, aim to identify more farming and irrigation groups and provide \nmore farming kits as well as training on effective farming. \n \n \nA farmer show cases his green house farm in one of the farm \ngroups where the Amiran Greenhouse Project has been \nimplemented.

Over 30 training sessions on greenhouse technology were conducted and over 20 farms \nhave been verified and certified to be used as project sites and 12 greenhouses have been installed. \n \nChallenges:  \nThe Amiran Greenhouse Project has been delayed in some areas because of; \n\u2022 \nLack of water supply for the farms identified for greenhouse installation. \n\u2022 \nInadequate funds to conduct training on effective farming practices. \n\u2022 \nUnavailability of government technical officers due to the distances between district headquarters \nand project sites.  \n \nProgress: \nThe KRCS conducted training sessions on PHAST methodologies for its volunteers. In January 2010, the \nNational Society supported the Ministry of Health to carry out a measles mop-up campaign in Nairobi. The \nNational Society was also able to conduct an awareness campaign on the cholera outbreak in West Pokot \nand Turkana. Medical supplies were distributed to hospitals in affected areas such as Lokitaung District \nHospital. Some drugs were stored in the Turkana Branch warehouse to enable easier response in the event \nof disease outbreaks in areas such as Kaaleng Division in Turkana North.  \nHealth and Care   \nObjective: To contribute to a reduction of morbidity and mortality in 60,000 drought affected beneficiaries in \nTana River District through taking health care services and products close to the beneficiaries by \nstrengthening community health structures and systems. \nExpected Results \nActivities planned\n\u2022 \nReduced morbidity and \nmortality due to \ncommunicable diseases \namong the affected \npopulation. \n\u2022 \nIncreased access to basic \ndrugs, nutritional \nsupplements and \nimmunization services. \n\u2022 \nImproved disease \nsurveillance systems that \nenhance regular reporting \nand feedback. \n \n\u2022 \nDevelopment of training and advocacy guides and tools for child survival, HIV \nand AIDS and community nutrition.  \n\u2022 \nEnhance the capacity of KRCS volunteers and MOH community health \nextension workers (CHEW).  \n\u2022 \nStakeholder sensitization/advocacy for MOH and KRCS branch management \ncommittee workshops.  \n\u2022 \nVolunteer/CHEWs training/seminars. \n\u2022 \nDesign and production of IEC materials (posters, t-shirts and banners) \n\u2022 \nCommunity outreach/training/advocacy. \n\u2022 \nDistribution of nutritional supplements from MOH facilities. \n\u2022 \nSupport MOH in mop-up campaigns for immunisation. \n\u2022 \nMonitoring and evaluation and/or support supervisions. \n\u2022 \nUpgrading of one health facility with a maternity wing. \n \n7 \n \nChallenges: \nThere were no immediate funds to purchase medical supplies promptly after the cholera outbreak. \n \nWater, sanitation, and hygiene promotion  \nObjective: Improve access to clean, safe and sustainable water and promote safe hygiene practices \ntargeting 50,000 drought affected persons in Tana River District.  \nExpected results \nActivities planned\n\u2022 \nImproved access to safe \nwater.  \n \n\u2022 \nDrill and equip two boreholes, construct one sand dam and five shallow \nwells at selected sites within the community. \n\u2022 \nLay ten kilometres of pipeline from the boreholes to enhance water supply \nto target communities. \n\u2022 \nEstablish and train eight water management committees to manage new \nand rehabilitated water facilities.  \n\u2022 \nDistribute water treatment tablets to 8,333 vulnerable households. \nObjective (b): To improve hygiene and appropriate gender responsive sanitation for an estimated 50,000 \ndrought affected persons in Tana River District. \nExpected results \nActivities planned\n\u2022 \nImproved health status of \nthe population through \nbehaviour change and \nhygiene promotion activities. \n\u2022 \nKey hygiene messages \ndisseminated effectively at \nhousehold/community level \nand positive hygiene \nbehaviour adopted by \ntargeted households. \n\u2022 \nSanitation access improved. \n\u2022 \nTrain 50 volunteers/TOTs on PHAST methodology. \n\u2022 \nConduct continuous hygiene promotion and awareness campaigns among \nthe affected individuals. \n\u2022 \nProduce and distribute generic hygiene promotional IEC materials. \n\u2022 \nConduct child to child hygiene promotion in 20 schools. \n\u2022 \nConstruction of ten VIP latrines. \n\u2022 \nProduction and distribution of SanPlats. \n \nProgress: \nKRCS has trained 39 volunteers on PHAST methodologies.

A total of ten latrines have been \nconstructed in the project sites. The National Society has also constructed two sand dams, equipped eight \nwater supply systems and trained thousands of community members on hygiene and sanitation. \n \nChallenges: \nIn some areas, implementation of projects was stalled as a result of delay in accessing funds. \n \nLogistics  \nObjective: To provide strong logistical support in transportation and warehousing in the affected areas to \nensure rapid access to beneficiaries in targeted areas. \nExpected results \nActivities planned\n\u2022 \nEfficient transportation of \nfarmers\u2019 kits and sanitation \nmaterials to final distribution \npoints. \n \n\u2022 \nTransport 50 MT of farmers\u2019 kits, water and sanitation materials and \nnutritional supplements to final distribution points. \n\u2022 \nIdentify suitable warehouses for storage of relief items. \n\u2022 \nMaintain mobilisation table.  \n\u2022 \nReinforce regional logistics capacity in warehousing and transportation. \n\u2022 \nProcure farmers\u2019 kits and water and sanitation supplies both locally and \ninternationally.  \n \nProgress:  \nThe National Society purchased and distributed 54 farmers\u2019 kits to the affected regions. In the Lower Eastern \nRegion, some farmers have already started to implement the techniques learnt during the farmer\u2019s kit \ntraining. The greenhouses provide a favourable atmosphere where the environment is controlled to ensure \ngood maturing of crops. \n \n \n \n \n8 \n \nTraining under the Amiran Greenhouse Project was conducted in May 2010 with participants from Mbooni, \nMachakos, Kathiani, Kaiti, Kibwezi, Makueni, Kilome, Masinga, Mwingi South, Mwala, Mwingi North, Kitui \nCentral, Gatanga, Mutitu and Yatta in Lower Eastern regions. A similar training was also conducted in Wajir \nfor participants from Mandera, Daadab and Garrissa in the North Rift Region.  \n \nChallenges: \nProgress in some areas was slow due to lack of water and the delays experienced in the delivery of seeds \nfrom suppliers which slowed down the seed distribution process. KRCS has been unable to conduct training \nin Tana River Region because of the delay in cash requests and procurement. Lack of Government technical \nofficers in some district headquarters due to the distance between head office and project sites and access \nto water was a problem especially in North Eastern District. \n \nCommunication, Advocacy and Reporting  \nObjective: To increase awareness on the drought situation and progress of interventions through \ndocumentation of best practices, advocacy, and monitoring, evaluation and reporting.  \nExpected results \nActivities planned\n\u2022 Enhanced communication \nbetween KRCS and partners \nby providing regular feedback \non interventions.  \n\u2022 Conduct baseline and end line surveys and regular monitoring and evaluation \nvisits.  \n\u2022 Coordination and networking \n9 \nAdvocacy \n9 \nProduce information bulletins and updating KRCS website. \n9 \nShare drought related information with other stakeholders. \n9 \nField trips for media coverage, documentation and donors. \n9 \nProduce and air radio/TV spots; and periodic publications. \n9 \nField communication. \n\u2022 Documentation of best practices and lessons learnt.  \n \nProgress: \nKRCS enhanced its communication and advocacy in order to profile the humanitarian situation caused by \nfood insecurity as a result of the drought. The media constantly consulted the National Society for \ninformation regarding the response operations. The National Society was featured on KTN and NTV \nhighlighting among other issues, drought, cholera outbreak and floods. KRCS organized a media trip, which \nhighlighted the harvest in Ukambani for senior management and key media partners. Various media covered \nthe KRCS\u2019 activities such as the commissioning of Katalwa-Mumbuni Water Project, which mirrored the \ndrought situation in Mwingi District. The National Society also provided updates to all media stations on the \ndrought crisis.  \n \nWebsite updates and news highlight stories were published, whilst the website was continuously updated to \ninform the general public on the drought situation. The National Society organised media trips on various \noccasions to highlight the drought situation and mobilise resources for the emergency appeal as well as \nother KRCS interventions. \n \n \n \n9 \n \n \nHow we work \nAll International Federation assistance seeks to adhere to the Code of Conduct for the \nInternational Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and Non-Governmental Organizations \n(NGO's) in Disaster Relief and is committed to the Humanitarian Charter and Minimum \nStandards in Disaster Response (Sphere) in delivering assistance to the most vulnerable. \nThe International Federation\u2019s vision \nis to inspire, encourage, facilitate and \npromote at all times all forms of \nhumanitarian activities by National \nSocieties, with a view to preventing \nand alleviating human suffering, and \nthereby \ncontributing \nto \nthe \nmaintenance \nand \npromotion \nof \nhuman dignity and peace in the \nworld.  \nThe International Federation\u2019s work is guided by Strategy 2020 \nwhich puts forward three strategic aims: \n1.

The DREF is a vital part of the International Federation\u2019s \ndisaster response system and increases the ability of National Societies to respond to disasters.  \n \nA total of 23,986 Swiss francs (22,379 US dollars/ \n16,340 euro) has been allocated from the Federation\u2019s \nDisaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) to deploy 2 \nRegional Intervention Team (RIT) members to perform \ninitial damage and need assessments and provide \nsupport to the National Societies of Barbados, \nGrenada, Guyana, Saint Lucia and Trinidad and \nTobago due to the effects of the drought. \n \nSummary: At the beginning of January 2010 several \nCaribbean countries began experiencing severe water \nshortages due to lack of rain, which affected the \nagricultural \nsector. \nThe \nCaribbean \nInstitute \nof \nMeteorology and Hydrology in Saint James, Barbados, issued drought alerts for the eastern Caribbean. In \nresponse a DREF was authorized to fund the deployment of two RIT, one specialized in water, sanitation \nand hygiene (WASH), and the other in food security and nutrition. The objective of the deployment was to \ncarry out a comprehensive assessment in affected areas within the south-eastern Caribbean and Guyana \nfrom a WASH and food security perspective, outline recommendations and develop a plan of action to \nrespond to the current situation to reduce future risk. Recommendations from the assessment focused on \ninstalling water tanks and rehabilitating wells in communities without storage capacity.  \n \nSince completion of the report the drought came to a precipitous end as rains have began to fall heavily on \nthe eastern Caribbean, easing conditions considerably. In order to reduce risk to future drought \nrecommendations related to water storage and well rehabilitation are being considered under the ECHO-\nfunded regional disaster risk reduction project.   \n \nThe major donors to the DREF are the Irish, Italian, Netherlands and Norwegian governments and ECHO. \nDetails of all donors can be found on: \nhttp://www.ifrc.org/what/disasters/responding/drs/tools/dref/donors.asp \n \n<click here for the final financial report, or here to view contact details> \n \nThe situation \nThe water level of the dam in Saint Lucia was reduced \nto the drought. Source: International Federation  \n \n \nAs the result of below average rainfall, the Caribbean \nInstitute of Meteorology and Hydrology (CIHM) in Saint \nJames, Barbados, issued drought alerts for the south-\neastern Caribbean. From October 2009 to January \n2010 the islands from Dominica southward to Trinidad \nhave \nexperienced \nmoderately \nto \nextremely \ndry \nconditions. Saint Lucia, Barbados, Saint Vincent and \nthe Grenadines and Grenada in particular have been \naffected by extremely dry weather. Water levels \ndropped quickly in several Caribbean countries, \nprompting officials to limit availability and impose \nrestrictions as the region entered its dry season.  \n \nWith below normal rainfall projected for the region from \nJanuary to March, water resource managers began \nrationing water and imposing restrictions on its use. This caused water shortages in many areas of the \ndifferent countries, especially in elevated areas where water pressure was insufficient to reach those heights.  \n \nMany farmers in the south-eastern Caribbean were also being affected by the lack of rain, either due to \nlimited rainfall for dry farming or reduction of irrigated water. This impacted farmers crop yields which in turn \nreduces the income of rural families. It also can lead to an increase in crop prices, leading to overall inflation \nand erosion of purchasing power.  \n \nIn order to determine the extent of the effects of the drought the assessment team used the following \nmethodology. \n\u2022 \nReview of secondary information  \n\u2022 \nMeeting with disaster agencies \n\u2022 \nMeeting with government/regional institutions concerning health, agriculture, and environmental \nhealth \n\u2022 \nMeeting with private sector stakeholders \n\u2022 \nInterviews with household and farmers \n\u2022 \nSite visits \nA brief summary of the assessment results for each country are included below:  \n \nGrenada \nThe drought conditions experienced in Grenada were some of the worst during the last 20 years and had a \ndirect impact on water resources and agriculture production in the country. In addition, more than 200 bush \nfires were registered by the fire service in country since the beginning of this year.  \n \nThe National Water Authority of Grenada (NAWASA) confronted the water shortage and began transporting \nwater to the different parishes. However, due to lack of storage capacity it was difficult to reach all the \nhouseholds that needed assistance. The parishes that suffered most from this shortage were: Saint Patrick, \nSaint David\u2019s, the southern part of Saint George, and the two sister islands Carriacou and Petite Martinique.  \n \nAs a result of the drought, vegetables, plantains, fruit and breadfruit crops were destroyed. Due to the \ncontinuous drought farmers were not able to replant until May when rains began falling again. Livestock \nfarmers had to decrease their herds into smaller or more manageable proportions because of pasture \nproblems and water shortage. These measures combined with the onset of the rainy season mitigated \nfurther deterioration of the system.  \n \nSaint Lucia \nSaint Lucia experienced a drought in 2001 and as a result the government developed a water management \ncontingency plan that could be implemented when drought conditions threatened the island. When it was \nfaced with a substantial decline in rainfall during the October 2009 and March 2010 the contingency plan \nwas implemented.   \n \nAlthough the country faced water shortage the following steps were taken which significantly mitigated its \naffects:   \n\u2022 \nRationing water in different areas in the country \n\u2022 \nTransportation of water to different areas, where the water pressure was low \n\u2022 \nRehabilitation of old water sources  \n \n \nDying banana trees suffering from water \nExamples of dying banana trees due to lack of \nwater. Source: International Federation   \n \n \n\u2022 \nEducation on efficient use of water  \nMost of the farmers in Saint Lucia depend on natural rainfall for agriculture production. As a result of the \ndrought there were the following consequences:  \n \n\u2022 Crop production declined \n\u2022 Reduction in banana production \n\u2022 Increase in production cost due to the trucking of water and labor \n\u2022 Increase of prices for agriculture commodities \n\u2022 Livestock affected by water storage and the decline in pasture.  \nBarbados \nSince the beginning October 2009, many parts of Barbados also experienced rainfall amounts well below \naverage. Although a reasonable water distribution system is in place in Barbados, the government asked \npeople to conserve water through actions such as cleaning of old wells, water conservation methods and \nimplementation of rainwater catchment. Additionally, they are also positioning water storage tanks in certain \nstrategic communities. \n \nBarbados imports most of its agricultural commodities although the agriculture sector had grown by seven \nper cent the previous year. Unfortunately, this year there will be a decline in the agricultural sector as a result \nof the drought. The water authority has started to ration the water supply for farmers, which is compounded \nby many wells and river being affected by salt intrusion. As a result farms are experiencing a drop in \nproductivity. The government is in the process of looking at an alternative support system for the farmers \nwho lost their productions. Measures being taken to improve the situation include, introducing alternative \nproduction techniques such as drip irrigation for efficient water use and composting to increase soil fertility. \nThe introduction of a kitchen garden is one of the activities that the Ministry of Agriculture wants to advocate \nto increase the nutritional value of the diet of the different households. \n \nGuyana \nGuyana is known throughout the world for its abundance of rivers. However, the western part of the country \nwas affected by the drought. In 1998 the country experienced a drought and as a result a water management \ncontingency plan was designed to respond to the drought conditions, especially for farmers. The current \ndrought was more severe compared to the drought in 1998. Despite the water management plan the effects \nof the drought were felt by the communities in western regions of the countries in the agricultural sector.  \n \nThe Guyana Water Authority initiated water use restrictions and a publicity campaign to reduce water use. \nPeople were asked to be proactive and deepen existing wells, but also reduce water use for activities such \nas car washing and lawn watering.   \n \nIn Guyana the major agriculture activities are on the coastal areas and these experienced a decline in \nproduction due to the intrusion of salt water in the irrigation systems. The two commercial agriculture \ncommodities rice and sugar experienced low yields due to the high temperatures and lack of irrigation water. \nCompared to the coastal areas, communities in the interior were more affected by the drought situation \nbecause of poor infrastructure which make the accessibility to these communities difficult. Most of the \nvillages are accessible only by the rivers and the low water levels restricted this communication route. The \nmajority of communities rely on the rivers to transport commodities from the city, which was made more \ndifficult due to the  low river levels.  \n \nFarmers have received assistance from the government through the El Ni\u00f1o Emergency Relief Found.      \n  \nTrinidad and Tobago \nIn Trinidad and Tobago, the government issued a state of emergency due to the drought and began rationing \nwater both for drinking and agriculture purposes. Communities that depended on wells were the most \naffected. The government began trucking water to these communities, but it was often felt to be insufficient. \nAs a result there were a number of protests which took place. In other areas, piped water rationing was done \nwith the number of days with running water per week reduced. Piped water for the agricultural sector was \nstopped and many of the rivers dried up. Moreover, farmers near the river with remaining water were \nrequired to have a permit to withdraw water from the rivers. \n \nCoordination and partnerships \nIn most of the countries a disaster management unit is installed to coordinate actions in a state of \nemergency. However, it was found that these agencies were not fully involved in the implementation and \n \n \ncoordination to mitigate the implication of the drought. Instead the national water authorities and Ministries of \nAgriculture were the main actors. The Red Cross National Societies worked to bridge this gap by \ncoordinating with different ministries, water authorities and national disaster management offices that had \nvarying levels of success in each country.   \n \nThe partnership with different communities through the community-based disaster management projects \nunderway facilitated communication with communities. Mitigation activities resulting from this assessment \nwill be linked into community-based disaster management projects wherever possible.  \n \nWith respect to food security it was strongly recommended that a new partnership is establish with the Inter- \nAmerican Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA). This organization operates in the Inter-American \nsystem and is mandated by the head of states of 34 countries in the western hemisphere to develop rural \nareas and agriculture. Food security is one of the major activities that IICA is involved. In each country there \nis an office were country level collaboration can take place. Suriname already has an agreement with this \norganization that will serve as a model for other societies interesting in taking this forward.  \n \nRed Cross and Red Crescent action \nThe National Societies from Barbados, Grenada, Guyana, Saint Lucia and Trinidad and Tobago were in \nconstant communication with the IFRC\u2019s Pan American Disaster Response Unit (PADRU) and the Caribbean \nRegional Representation Office based in Port of Spain in order to coordinate possible actions. \n \nMany of the National Societies in the region benefit from disaster preparedness programmes, focusing on \nVulnerability Capacity Assessments (VCA), Community Disaster Response Teams (CDRT), micro-mitigation \nprojects and trained national intervention teams (NITs). There is support by regional training in these areas, \nas well as sharing lessons learnt through the Regional Disaster Management Network. Nevertheless, as the \nmajority of National Societies did not have experience in responding to this type of emergency an external \nassessment team was mobilized.  \n \nThe needs \nThese consequences of the drought were not as severe as they could have been due to government actions \nto ration and distribute water to areas in need; however, the situation remained precarious until early May \nwhen rains began to fall heavily on the south-eastern Caribbean easing conditions considerably. However, \nthere remains a need for the following actions to reduce risk to future droughts:  \n \n\u2022 Implement water catchment and/or storage systems that can improve access to potable water in the \ndifferent communities.  \n\u2022 Educate the communities and the population in conservation and treatment of water. \nThe operation \n \nDamage and need assessments \nObjective: Two RIT members, with the Red Cross Societies of Barbados, Grenada, Guyana, \nTrinidad and Tobago and Saint Lucia, will perform damage and needs assessments in the \nCaribbean countries affected by the drought and will define the plan of action to address the \nneeds. \nActivities planned:  \n\u2022 Conduct four assessment workshops for volunteers.  \n\u2022  Conduct emergency damage and needs assessments. \n\u2022 Elaborate a plan of action (if/as required). \nTwo RIT members travelled to the Red Cross National Societies of Barbados, Grenada, Guyana, Saint Lucia \nand Trinidad and Tobago to perform assessments of the drought and define a plan of action to address the \nneed. Based on these assessments, and taking into consideration the sudden end to drought conditions, it \nwas decided that the Red Cross National Societies would focus on actions that reduced risk to future \ndroughts, specifically water storage and well rehabilitation.  \nThe following actions are being considered as part of this:  \nGrenada: Purchase and installation of three 1,000 gallon water tanks \nBarbados: Purchase and installation of one 1,000 gallon water tank \nGuyana: Distribution of jerrycans and purification tablets  \nSaint Lucia: Purchase and installation of one 1000 gallon water tank  \n \n \nTrinidad and Tobago: Purchase and installation of one 1,000 gallon water tank and rehabilitation of wells \n \nSupport for these actions will be provided through the ECHO-funded regional disaster preparedness project.  \nHow we work \nAll International Federation assistance seeks to adhere to the Code of Conduct for the International \nRed Cross and Red Crescent Movement and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO's) in Disaster \nRelief and the Humanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards in Disaster Response (Sphere) in \ndelivering assistance to the most vulnerable. \n \nThe International Federation\u2019s vision is to inspire, \nencourage, facilitate and promote at all times all \nforms of humanitarian activities by National \nSocieties, with a view to preventing and alleviating \nhuman suffering, and thereby contributing to the \nmaintenance and promotion of human dignity and \npeace in the world.   \nThe International Federation\u2019s work is guided by \nStrategy 2020 which puts forward three strategic aims: \n1. Save lives, protect livelihoods, and strengthen \nrecovery from disaster and crises. \n2. Enable healthy and safe living. \n3.

Source: International \nFederation \n \n \n \nParaguay: Drought \nDREF operation n\u00b0 MDRPY007 \nGlide No. DR-2009-000104-PRY \nFinal Report \n23 November 2009 \nThe International Federation\u2019s Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) is a source of un-earmarked \nmoney created by the Federation in 1985 to ensure that immediate financial support is available for Red \nCross Red Crescent response to emergencies. The DREF is a vital part of the International Federation\u2019s \ndisaster response system and increases the ability of National Societies to respond to disasters. \nSummary: CHF 237,515 (USD 218,944 or EUR 156,360) was allocated from the Federation\u2019s Disaster \nRelief Emergency Fund (DREF) on 26 May 2009 to support the Paraguayan Red Cross (PRC) in \ndelivering immediate assistance to some 1,624 families (approximately 8,120 beneficiaries). \n \nThe Paraguayan Red Cross completed a plan of \naction and implemented it to meet the needs of \nthose affected in five departments (Concepci\u00f3n, \n\u00d1eembuc\u00fa, Presidente Hayes, Boquer\u00f3n and \nAlto Paraguay) in Paraguay. Priority was given to \nfive rural and fishing communities in the districts \nof Horqueta, Concepci\u00f3n (in the department of \nConcepci\u00f3n), and Tacuaras, Paso de Patria and \nIsla Umbu (in the department of \u00d1eembuc\u00fa). \n \nThis operation initially was established to benefit \n1,100 families in the areas referred to above. \nHowever, the National Society was able to \nincrease its target to 1,624 families thanks to the \nsupport of the Paraguayan government as \nexplained in the DREF Update n\u00b0 1. At the close \nof the operation, it was possible to reach a total \nof 1,743 rural families with food and seeds for \nrevival of their crops damaged by drought. This \nsignificant achievement was due to the support \nfrom the government\u2019s National Emergency \nSecretariat \nwhich \ncovered \nlogistics \ncosts \n(transport and fuel) that enabled the PRC to \noptimize resources to reach more people \naffected by the situation in those departments. \n \nIn terms of results set out for this intervention \nboth objectives were accomplished. Particularly \nthe second objective, which refers to the \nrecovery of crops, has had a positive impact on the affected families who benefited from the distribution of \nseeds and tools. This objective incorporated technical assistance thanks agronomists as an added value \nto the operation. At the closing of this final report, the crops are in full growth stage. This DREF operation \nwas completed in three months. \n \nThe major donors to the DREF are the Irish, Italian, Netherlands and Norwegian governments and ECHO. \nDetails \nof \nall \ndonors \ncan \nbe \nfound \non:  \nhttp://www.ifrc.org/what/disasters/responding/drs/tools/dref/donors.asp \n<Click here for the final financial report, or here to view contact details> \n \nShade cloths used to protect harvested crops. Source: \nInternational Federation \n \n \nThe situation \nOn 11 May 2009, the Paraguayan government \ndeclared a state of emergency due to the \nsevere \ndrought \nin \nthe \ndepartments \nof \nConcepci\u00f3n, \u00d1eembuc\u00fa, Presidente Hayes, \nBoquer\u00f3n and Alto Paraguay. The state of \nemergency prompted the intervention of all \nMinistries and government institutions, including \nthe National Emergency Secretariat (Secretar\u00eda \nNacional de Emergencia - SEN). Emergency \nmeasures were implemented and the SEN \nassisted \nthe \naffected \ncommunities, \nboth \nindigenous, rural and other affected populations \nthrough actions including rehabilitation of \nlivelihoods \nfocused \non \nagriculture, \nsocial \nassistance and health. \n \nDamage assessments performed by the SEN \nand reports from the departmental authorities of \nConcepci\u00f3n described a lack of water and high \nrisk of outbreaks of fires. Between 30,000 and \n50,000 families were affected by the emergency.  \n \nIn the department of \u00d1eembuc\u00fa, there was a lack of water and food items. According to the report from the \nSEN there were approximately 25,000 people affected. The drastic climatic changes experienced during the \npast years in the region and especially the yearly droughts had affected the agricultural sector. This situation \nwas critical since farmers have not been able to produce food and the access to food items was scarce. The \nMinistry of Agriculture reported a decrease in the production levels of crops, including maize, beans and \nyucca over recent years.  \n \nThus, the operation financed by the DREF funds prioritized the distribution of food items to the most affected \ncommunities in Concepci\u00f3n and \u00d1eembuc\u00fa. Additionally, the agricultural rehabilitation was included in the \nassistance in order to boost the families\u2019 livelihoods. \n \nInitially, the plan of action intended to assist 1,110 families working in agricultural activities, with food items \nand seeds. As a result of the efficient joint coordination with the government, specifically with the logistical \nresources provided by governmental agencies, the assistance reached an additional 643 families than \noriginally planned. This increase in families reached has reinforced the positive impact of the operation since \nit is foreseen that between November and December the rehabilitated crops will produce the first harvest. \n \nRed Cross and \nRed Crescent \naction \nThis emergency operation, which \nstarted at the end of May 2009 and \nwas completed by 26 August 2009, \naimed \nto \nprovide \nemergency \nassistance to the rural and peri-\nurban \nfamilies \naffected \nby \nthe \ndrought \nin \nthe \ndepartments \nof \nConcepcion and \u00d1eembuc\u00fa. The \nobjective consisted in providing food \nitems and seeds to rehabilitate the \ncrops \nin \nthe \ndepartments \nof \nConcepci\u00f3n \nand \n\u00d1eembuc\u00fa \nfor \n1,100 families. As mentioned above, \nthis DREF operation was able to \nsurpass the initial target and reach \n1,743 families. \n \n \n \nThe Regional Intervention Team (RIT) member facilitating the Early \nRecovery workshop with Paraguayan Red Cross volunteers. \nSource: International Federation \nInterviews conducted by the PRC volunteers with the affected families indicated the most viable means of \nsubsistence are vegetable crops which are able to resist the low temperatures of the Chaco region. Two \nlocal agronomists with ample experience in the area and the type of crops and soil of the region were hired. \nThe agronomists made an analysis and drew up a work plan in order to reactivate agricultural activities. A \nRegional Intervention Team (RIT) member was deployed to Paraguay in mid July to support the National \nSociety with the rehabilitation of livelihoods. \n \nAchievements against objectives \n \nThe main objective of supplying families with food kits of 47 kg. (1,046 kilocalories each kit) for one month \nand rehabilitating their crops for their daily subsistence was fulfilled. A total of 1,743 families received \ncomplementary food parcels and 1,270 families received seeds and technical assistances to rehabilitate their \ncrops. \n \nFood items: It was initially planned to procure 1,100 food parcels for the affected families including the bags \nfor distribution; but since there were savings due to the transportation provided by the National Emergency \nSecretariat which covered all transportation costs for the distributions, additional food parcels were \npurchased, and a total of 1,743 families were reached through the distributions.  \n \nSeeds and agricultural tools: Since the beginning of the operation it was planned to provide 1,100 seed \nkits, but due to negotiations between the PRC and the supplier, the number of families targeted was \nincreased.  After the assessments carried out by the agronomists, the following products were procured:  \n \nSeeds \n34,836,46 kilos \nShade cloth \n6,000 meters \nSilos \n140 units for 7 communities  \nFungicide \n7 litres \n \n \nRelief distributions (food and basic non-food items)  \nObjective: To assist 1,100 of the most vulnerable families in the departments of Concepci\u00f3n and \n\u00d1eembuc\u00fa with humanitarian aid consisting of supplementary food items. \n \nActivities completed:  \n\u2022 \nConduct rapid emergency needs and capacity assessments. \n\u2022 \nDevelop a beneficiary targeting strategy and registration system to deliver intended assistance. \n\u2022 \nCoordinate with the local branch president in Concepcion for presentation of proposal.  \n\u2022 \nCoordinate with municipalities involved and community leaders.  \n\u2022 \nVisits to the benefited communities.  \n\u2022 \nSelection of suppliers.  \n\u2022 \nMonthly distribution of a 47kg food parcel to the 1,100 families that are small farmers.  \n\u2022 \nMonitor and evaluate the relief activities and provide reporting on relief distributions.  \n\u2022 \nDevelop an exit strategy. \n \nImpact: \n1,743 families received food items to cover their nutritional needs for one month.

Nevertheless, the \nNational Society held meetings with local authorities to seek viable alternatives for the affected communities.  \n \nRehabilitation of livelihoods \nObjective: 1,100 of the most affected small farmer families in the departments of Concepci\u00f3n and \n\u00d1eembuc\u00fa will receive seeds to sow new crops.  \n \nActivities completed:   \n\u2022 \nTwo agronomists will perform damage and needs assessments in the communities affected by the \ndrought and will provide a proposal for each department.  \n\u2022 \nThe agronomists will elaborate a chronogram of activities on the distribution of the seeds.  \n\u2022 \nSelection and census of beneficiaries.  \n\u2022 \nSelection of suppliers and procurement.  \n\u2022 \nDistribution of seeds to affected families.  \n\u2022 \nAgronomists will provide technical assistance.  \n\u2022 \nMonitoring and evaluation. \n \nImpact:  \n \nThe agronomists hired to support the operation prepared a field study to draw up a plan prior to the \ndistribution of the seed kits, to assist the small farmer families in the departments of Concepcion and \n\u00d1eembuc\u00fa. The climate conditions among both departments are different as well as the type of soil. As a \nresult of the field study completed by the agronomists it was decided to provide the appropriate type of \nseeds depending on the climate and type of soil of each department. In addition, the agronomists carried out \ntraining workshops and developed a planting manual to instruct the benefited families on how to use and \nsow the seeds distributed and how to prepare the soil before planting the seeds. \n \nA total of 1,270 families rehabilitated 1,160 hectares of crops with the seed kits (one kit per family) and \ntechnical assistance provided by the agronomists. The families have started to obtain harvested food from \nthese crops to sell or for self-consumption.  \n \nThe following table shows the number of families by district and departments: \n \nDEPARTAMENT OF CONCEPCI\u00d3N \nDistrict \nCommunity \nNucleus or Committee \nN\u00b0 of families \nN\u00b0 of people \nHorqueta \nArroyito \nNucleus one \n114 \n591 \nNucleus two \n77 \n400 \nNucleus three \n256 \n1325 \nNucleus four \n104 \n627 \nNucleus five \n83 \n434 \nNucleus six \n104 \n553 \nNucleus seven \n61 \n344 \nConcepci\u00f3n \nProductores \nAsociados \ndel \nCentro \nde \nAcopio \nde \nConcepci\u00f3n \n- \nPACAC \nSan Juan Bosco Committee \u2013 \nCulantrillo \n12 \n84 \nMujeres \nMar\u00eda \nAuxiliadora \nCommittee \u2013 Culantrillo \n7 \n34 \nJacinto de Le\u00f3n Committee \u2013 \nCulantrillo \n9 \n52 \nMujeres \nSan \nCayetano \nCommittee \u2013 Culantrillo \n10 \n56 \nRinc\u00f3n de Luna Committee \u2013 \nSanta Rosa \n9 \n54 \nChokokue \nAty \nCommittee\u2013 \nCulantrillo \n6 \n33 \nCentral Committee \u2013 Potrerito \n17 \n122 \nSagrado Coraz\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas \nCommittee \u2013 Culantrillo \n15 \n99 \nMujeres Juaihup\u00e1 Committee\u2013 \npotrerito \n12 \n101 \nSagrada Familia Committee \u2013 \nSagrada Familia \n8 \n40 \nTeko \nPora \nCommittee \n\u2013 \nCulantrillo \n10 \n45 \nIntegral de Calle 11 Committee \n9 \n60 \nTotal Department of Concepci\u00f3n \n 923 \n5,054 \nDEPARTMENT OF \u00d1EEMBUCU \nDistrict \nCommunities \nN\u00b0 of families \nN\u00b0 of people \nIsla Umb\u00fa \nTacur\u00fa Puc\u00fa \n35 \n111 \n \nValle Po\u00ed \n55 \n190 \n \nLoma Clavel \n30 \n97 \n \nCamba Cu\u00e1 \n32 \n128 \n \nBoquer\u00f3n \n51 \n163 \n \nIslerias \n87 \n224 \n \nCosta Puc\u00fa \n57 \n222 \nTotal Department of \u00d1eembuc\u00fa \n 347 \n1,135 \nTOTAL DEPARTAMENT OF CONCEPCION AND \u00d1EEMBUCU \n 1,270 \n 6,189 \n \nEach seed kit distributed contained the following: \n \nCONCEPCI\u00d3N \n \nN\u00ba \nCrop \nQuantity \n1 \nMaize Tup\u00ed \n7.5  g \n2 \nMaize Chipa \n7.5 g \n3 \nMaize Pichinga \n3.5g \n4 \nBean \n7.5g \n5 \nPea \n5g \n6 \nTomato \n10g \n7 \nPepper \n10g \n8 \nCarrot \n5g \n9 \nChard \n5g \n10 \nOnion \n3g \n11 \nCabbage \n3g \n12 \nLettuce \n5g \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00d1EEMBUC\u00da \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe RIT deployed to Paraguay provided support to the National Society and carried out an Early Recovery \nworkshop.

The DREF is a vital part of the International Federation\u2019s \ndisaster response system and increases the ability of National Societies to respond to disasters. \nSummary: CHF 237,515 (USD 218,944 or EUR 156,360) was allocated from the Federation\u2019s Disaster \nRelief Emergency Fund (DREF) on 26 May 2009 to support the Paraguayan Red Cross (PRC) in \ndelivering immediate assistance to some 1,624 families (approximately 8,120 beneficiaries). \n \nThe Paraguayan Red Cross completed a plan of \naction and implemented it to meet the needs of \nthose affected in five departments (Concepci\u00f3n, \n\u00d1eembuc\u00fa, Presidente Hayes, Boquer\u00f3n and \nAlto Paraguay) in Paraguay. Priority was given to \nfive rural and fishing communities in the districts \nof Horqueta, Concepci\u00f3n (in the department of \nConcepci\u00f3n), and Tacuaras, Paso de Patria and \nIsla Umbu (in the department of \u00d1eembuc\u00fa). \n \nThis operation initially was established to benefit \n1,100 families in the areas referred to above. \nHowever, the National Society was able to \nincrease its target to 1,624 families thanks to the \nsupport of the Paraguayan government as \nexplained in the DREF Update n\u00b0 1. At the close \nof the operation, it was possible to reach a total \nof 1,743 rural families with food and seeds for \nrevival of their crops damaged by drought. This \nsignificant achievement was due to the support \nfrom the government\u2019s National Emergency \nSecretariat \nwhich \ncovered \nlogistics \ncosts \n(transport and fuel) that enabled the PRC to \noptimize resources to reach more people \naffected by the situation in those departments. \n \nIn terms of results set out for this intervention \nboth objectives were accomplished. Particularly \nthe second objective, which refers to the \nrecovery of crops, has had a positive impact on the affected families who benefited from the distribution of \nseeds and tools. This objective incorporated technical assistance thanks agronomists as an added value \nto the operation. At the closing of this final report, the crops are in full growth stage. This DREF operation \nwas completed in three months. \n \nThe major donors to the DREF are the Irish, Italian, Netherlands and Norwegian governments and ECHO. \nDetails \nof \nall \ndonors \ncan \nbe \nfound \non:  \nhttp://www.ifrc.org/what/disasters/responding/drs/tools/dref/donors.asp \n<Click here for the final financial report, or here to view contact details> \n \nShade cloths used to protect harvested crops. Source: \nInternational Federation \n \n \nThe situation \nOn 11 May 2009, the Paraguayan government \ndeclared a state of emergency due to the \nsevere \ndrought \nin \nthe \ndepartments \nof \nConcepci\u00f3n, \u00d1eembuc\u00fa, Presidente Hayes, \nBoquer\u00f3n and Alto Paraguay. The state of \nemergency prompted the intervention of all \nMinistries and government institutions, including \nthe National Emergency Secretariat (Secretar\u00eda \nNacional de Emergencia - SEN). Emergency \nmeasures were implemented and the SEN \nassisted \nthe \naffected \ncommunities, \nboth \nindigenous, rural and other affected populations \nthrough actions including rehabilitation of \nlivelihoods \nfocused \non \nagriculture, \nsocial \nassistance and health. \n \nDamage assessments performed by the SEN \nand reports from the departmental authorities of \nConcepci\u00f3n described a lack of water and high \nrisk of outbreaks of fires. Between 30,000 and \n50,000 families were affected by the emergency.  \n \nIn the department of \u00d1eembuc\u00fa, there was a lack of water and food items. According to the report from the \nSEN there were approximately 25,000 people affected. The drastic climatic changes experienced during the \npast years in the region and especially the yearly droughts had affected the agricultural sector. This situation \nwas critical since farmers have not been able to produce food and the access to food items was scarce. The \nMinistry of Agriculture reported a decrease in the production levels of crops, including maize, beans and \nyucca over recent years.  \n \nThus, the operation financed by the DREF funds prioritized the distribution of food items to the most affected \ncommunities in Concepci\u00f3n and \u00d1eembuc\u00fa. Additionally, the agricultural rehabilitation was included in the \nassistance in order to boost the families\u2019 livelihoods. \n \nInitially, the plan of action intended to assist 1,110 families working in agricultural activities, with food items \nand seeds. As a result of the efficient joint coordination with the government, specifically with the logistical \nresources provided by governmental agencies, the assistance reached an additional 643 families than \noriginally planned. This increase in families reached has reinforced the positive impact of the operation since \nit is foreseen that between November and December the rehabilitated crops will produce the first harvest. \n \nRed Cross and \nRed Crescent \naction \nThis emergency operation, which \nstarted at the end of May 2009 and \nwas completed by 26 August 2009, \naimed \nto \nprovide \nemergency \nassistance to the rural and peri-\nurban \nfamilies \naffected \nby \nthe \ndrought \nin \nthe \ndepartments \nof \nConcepcion and \u00d1eembuc\u00fa. The \nobjective consisted in providing food \nitems and seeds to rehabilitate the \ncrops \nin \nthe \ndepartments \nof \nConcepci\u00f3n \nand \n\u00d1eembuc\u00fa \nfor \n1,100 families. As mentioned above, \nthis DREF operation was able to \nsurpass the initial target and reach \n1,743 families. \n \n \n \nThe Regional Intervention Team (RIT) member facilitating the Early \nRecovery workshop with Paraguayan Red Cross volunteers. \nSource: International Federation \nInterviews conducted by the PRC volunteers with the affected families indicated the most viable means of \nsubsistence are vegetable crops which are able to resist the low temperatures of the Chaco region. Two \nlocal agronomists with ample experience in the area and the type of crops and soil of the region were hired. \nThe agronomists made an analysis and drew up a work plan in order to reactivate agricultural activities. A \nRegional Intervention Team (RIT) member was deployed to Paraguay in mid July to support the National \nSociety with the rehabilitation of livelihoods. \n \nAchievements against objectives \n \nThe main objective of supplying families with food kits of 47 kg. (1,046 kilocalories each kit) for one month \nand rehabilitating their crops for their daily subsistence was fulfilled. A total of 1,743 families received \ncomplementary food parcels and 1,270 families received seeds and technical assistances to rehabilitate their \ncrops. \n \nFood items: It was initially planned to procure 1,100 food parcels for the affected families including the bags \nfor distribution; but since there were savings due to the transportation provided by the National Emergency \nSecretariat which covered all transportation costs for the distributions, additional food parcels were \npurchased, and a total of 1,743 families were reached through the distributions.  \n \nSeeds and agricultural tools: Since the beginning of the operation it was planned to provide 1,100 seed \nkits, but due to negotiations between the PRC and the supplier, the number of families targeted was \nincreased.  After the assessments carried out by the agronomists, the following products were procured:  \n \nSeeds \n34,836,46 kilos \nShade cloth \n6,000 meters \nSilos \n140 units for 7 communities  \nFungicide \n7 litres \n \n \nRelief distributions (food and basic non-food items)  \nObjective: To assist 1,100 of the most vulnerable families in the departments of Concepci\u00f3n and \n\u00d1eembuc\u00fa with humanitarian aid consisting of supplementary food items. \n \nActivities completed:  \n\u2022 \nConduct rapid emergency needs and capacity assessments. \n\u2022 \nDevelop a beneficiary targeting strategy and registration system to deliver intended assistance. \n\u2022 \nCoordinate with the local branch president in Concepcion for presentation of proposal.  \n\u2022 \nCoordinate with municipalities involved and community leaders.  \n\u2022 \nVisits to the benefited communities.  \n\u2022 \nSelection of suppliers.  \n\u2022 \nMonthly distribution of a 47kg food parcel to the 1,100 families that are small farmers.  \n\u2022 \nMonitor and evaluate the relief activities and provide reporting on relief distributions.  \n\u2022 \nDevelop an exit strategy. \n \nImpact: \n1,743 families received food items to cover their nutritional needs for one month.

Nevertheless, the \nNational Society held meetings with local authorities to seek viable alternatives for the affected communities.  \n \nRehabilitation of livelihoods \nObjective: 1,100 of the most affected small farmer families in the departments of Concepci\u00f3n and \n\u00d1eembuc\u00fa will receive seeds to sow new crops.  \n \nActivities completed:   \n\u2022 \nTwo agronomists will perform damage and needs assessments in the communities affected by the \ndrought and will provide a proposal for each department.  \n\u2022 \nThe agronomists will elaborate a chronogram of activities on the distribution of the seeds.  \n\u2022 \nSelection and census of beneficiaries.  \n\u2022 \nSelection of suppliers and procurement.  \n\u2022 \nDistribution of seeds to affected families.  \n\u2022 \nAgronomists will provide technical assistance.  \n\u2022 \nMonitoring and evaluation. \n \nImpact:  \n \nThe agronomists hired to support the operation prepared a field study to draw up a plan prior to the \ndistribution of the seed kits, to assist the small farmer families in the departments of Concepcion and \n\u00d1eembuc\u00fa. The climate conditions among both departments are different as well as the type of soil. As a \nresult of the field study completed by the agronomists it was decided to provide the appropriate type of \nseeds depending on the climate and type of soil of each department. In addition, the agronomists carried out \ntraining workshops and developed a planting manual to instruct the benefited families on how to use and \nsow the seeds distributed and how to prepare the soil before planting the seeds. \n \nA total of 1,270 families rehabilitated 1,160 hectares of crops with the seed kits (one kit per family) and \ntechnical assistance provided by the agronomists. The families have started to obtain harvested food from \nthese crops to sell or for self-consumption.  \n \nThe following table shows the number of families by district and departments: \n \nDEPARTAMENT OF CONCEPCI\u00d3N \nDistrict \nCommunity \nNucleus or Committee \nN\u00b0 of families \nN\u00b0 of people \nHorqueta \nArroyito \nNucleus one \n114 \n591 \nNucleus two \n77 \n400 \nNucleus three \n256 \n1325 \nNucleus four \n104 \n627 \nNucleus five \n83 \n434 \nNucleus six \n104 \n553 \nNucleus seven \n61 \n344 \nConcepci\u00f3n \nProductores \nAsociados \ndel \nCentro \nde \nAcopio \nde \nConcepci\u00f3n \n- \nPACAC \nSan Juan Bosco Committee \u2013 \nCulantrillo \n12 \n84 \nMujeres \nMar\u00eda \nAuxiliadora \nCommittee \u2013 Culantrillo \n7 \n34 \nJacinto de Le\u00f3n Committee \u2013 \nCulantrillo \n9 \n52 \nMujeres \nSan \nCayetano \nCommittee \u2013 Culantrillo \n10 \n56 \nRinc\u00f3n de Luna Committee \u2013 \nSanta Rosa \n9 \n54 \nChokokue \nAty \nCommittee\u2013 \nCulantrillo \n6 \n33 \nCentral Committee \u2013 Potrerito \n17 \n122 \nSagrado Coraz\u00f3n de Jes\u00fas \nCommittee \u2013 Culantrillo \n15 \n99 \nMujeres Juaihup\u00e1 Committee\u2013 \npotrerito \n12 \n101 \nSagrada Familia Committee \u2013 \nSagrada Familia \n8 \n40 \nTeko \nPora \nCommittee \n\u2013 \nCulantrillo \n10 \n45 \nIntegral de Calle 11 Committee \n9 \n60 \nTotal Department of Concepci\u00f3n \n 923 \n5,054 \nDEPARTMENT OF \u00d1EEMBUCU \nDistrict \nCommunities \nN\u00b0 of families \nN\u00b0 of people \nIsla Umb\u00fa \nTacur\u00fa Puc\u00fa \n35 \n111 \n \nValle Po\u00ed \n55 \n190 \n \nLoma Clavel \n30 \n97 \n \nCamba Cu\u00e1 \n32 \n128 \n \nBoquer\u00f3n \n51 \n163 \n \nIslerias \n87 \n224 \n \nCosta Puc\u00fa \n57 \n222 \nTotal Department of \u00d1eembuc\u00fa \n 347 \n1,135 \nTOTAL DEPARTAMENT OF CONCEPCION AND \u00d1EEMBUCU \n 1,270 \n 6,189 \n \nEach seed kit distributed contained the following: \n \nCONCEPCI\u00d3N \n \nN\u00ba \nCrop \nQuantity \n1 \nMaize Tup\u00ed \n7.5  g \n2 \nMaize Chipa \n7.5 g \n3 \nMaize Pichinga \n3.5g \n4 \nBean \n7.5g \n5 \nPea \n5g \n6 \nTomato \n10g \n7 \nPepper \n10g \n8 \nCarrot \n5g \n9 \nChard \n5g \n10 \nOnion \n3g \n11 \nCabbage \n3g \n12 \nLettuce \n5g \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00d1EEMBUC\u00da \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe RIT deployed to Paraguay provided support to the National Society and carried out an Early Recovery \nworkshop.

The team worked jointly with government officials from the department of \nBoquer\u00f3n and with local government branches in the municipalities of Filadelfia and Mariscal Estigarribia, \ncarrying out damage and need assessments as well as identification of families affected by the drought.  \nThe International Federation, through its Pan American Disaster Response Unit (PADRU) and the \nRegional Representation for the Andean Region, provided support to the PRC from the outset of the \nemergency. A Regional Intervention Team (RIT) member specialized in water and sanitation was \ndeployed to Paraguay for one month to provide technical support for the operation.  The Agency for \nInternational Development of the United States government (USAID) channelled emergency funds for \nassisting families in the Department of Boquer\u00f3n. Other organizations including the Inter-American \nDevelopment Bank (IADB) and the European Commission\u2019s Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO) provided \nfunds to rehabilitate water systems. Additionally, the Italian government replenished DREF in the amount \nof CHF 80,750.  \n \n<Click here for the final financial report, or here to view contact details> \n \nThe situation \n \nThe Central Region of Chaco covers 60 per cent of the country and includes the departments of Alto \nParaguay, Boquer\u00f3n and Presidente Hayes. The region of Chaco has significant climatic variations and \nunique geological characteristics that create a great variety of ecological phenomena including plains, dry \nsavannas \u2014that seasonally flood\u2014, swamplands and extensive forests and brush land. One of the major \nproblems this area faces is the extreme cyclical droughts and flooding. According to the Nature \nConservancy, the river water levels in the mountain range area during the rainy season reach very high \npeaks and diminish dramatically during the dry season. The sustainability of agriculture is severely impacted \nby these drastic changes as the soil becomes highly impermeable causing floods during the rainy season \nwhile during dry season the soil becomes sandy with poor nutrients.  \n \nAdditionally, the local population comprises mainly small-scale farmers and indigenous communities which \nface severe socio-economic challenges such as poverty, low wages, chronic malnutrition and low food \nsupply, compounded by environmental concerns such as deforestation, general degradation of soil \nproductivity and scarcity of water. The territorial and socio-economic framework of the region indicates that \nmost of these impacts are frequently under-reported or they do not receive visibility at the international level, \na phenomenon regularly known as \u201csilent disasters\u201d. \n \nNotably, more than 60 per cent of the population is living below the poverty line and the most vulnerable are \nthe indigenous communities that do not have enough land to cultivate and generate the income to afford \nbasic necessities. The prolonged drought has deteriorated the population\u2019s basic subsistence as \ncommunities have temporarily lost the ability to produce their own food and secure their own water supply. \n \nAccording to SEN, health reports indicate high levels of respiratory and flu-like symptoms due to the drastic \nweather changes and the presence of constant strong winds coming in from the north. In addition, \nundernourishment due to the low food supply has caused the death of six children and low school \nperformance. \n \nRed Cross and Red Crescent action \n \nSince the beginning of the emergency, the Paraguayan Red Cross activated its local and central response \nteams. A National Intervention Team (NIT) was deployed along with a volunteer trained as a RIT member \nspecialized in information and reporting to support the local PRC branch in Boquer\u00f3n. The team was jointly \ncoordinating the gathering of information with the local authorities of Boquer\u00f3n and sub-authorities of \nFiladelfia, Loma Plata and Mcal. Estigarribia. A plan of action was drawn up in coordination with the Pan \nAmerican Disaster Response Unit in Panama. In addition, a water and sanitation specialist was deployed for \none month with the objective of completing an exhaustive and complete diagnosis of the potable water \nsupply systems in the department of Boquer\u00f3n. \n \nThe local branches have worked actively since the beginning of the year in risk management processes at \ndepartmental level through a Preparedness and Multi-Hazard Risk Reduction Project financed by ECHO \n(DIPECHO-V). The branches activated all processes with actors involved as established within the \nframework of the project. \n \nThe PRC mobilized technical personnel, disaster response specialists with expertise in logistics, purchasing, \nhealth and administration. The Paraguayan Red Cross also utilized the PRC volunteer work in the \nintervention and worked in close coordination with SEN.  \n \nThe support provided by the local branches and team members from the department of Boquer\u00f3n in guiding \nand directing the actions has been invaluable. Risk management processes have been enhanced and  \ncoordinated response actions with the Emergency Operations Centre located in Cruce Los Pioneros, Chaco \nwere made possible thanks to their efforts. \n \nThe Paraguayan government supported PRC activities by providing fuel in order to access some \ncommunities. Since the beginning of the emergency the government has been assisting the National Society \nwith resources including a vehicle and personnel to carry out the distribution activities.   \nProgress towards objectives \n \nRelief distributions (food items)  \nObjective: To assist 900 of the most vulnerable families in the departments of Boquer\u00f3n with \nhumanitarian aid consisting of supplementary food items.  \nActivities completed: \n\u2022 \nRevision of community list.  \n\u2022 \nList update after field visits (visits to each potential beneficiary family).  \n\u2022 \nPreparation of distribution tables.  \n\u2022 \nLocal procurement of food items.  \n\u2022 \nPackaging and labelling of food parcels.  \n\u2022 \nElaboration and updating census with government listings. \n\u2022 \nOrganization of volunteer groups. \n\u2022 \nOrganization with community leaders to notify distributions.  \n\u2022 \nMobilization and delivery of food parcels to each family (with signature of each head of family).  \n \nThe criteria for selection of the beneficiary families focused on indigenous families affected by the drought in \nthe department of Boquer\u00f3n. Mobilization and delivery of food parcels to each family (with signature of each \nhead of family and or community leader representative), are carried out according to distribution charts made \nafter a census was completed in the beneficiary communities. Communities received food parcels after \npresenting proper identification.  Due to the drought season the indigenous communities were affected with \nlack of water. As a result family\u2019s food intake was reduced from three daily meals to one meal a day; \ntherefore affecting their health. During the last phase, there was a noticeable improvement in the quality of \nlife of the affected people thanks to the food items distributed, which followed Sphere standards (increasing \nnutritional conditions). Consequently, health conditions improved, especially among children and the elderly \nwho are the most vulnerable. \n \nImpact:  \nThe plan of action initially contemplated distribution of a 47 kg. food parcel to 900 families in the indigenous \ncommunities of the department of Boquer\u00f3n for a period of one month.   \n \nAn agreement was reached with the SEN, where the SEN would provide transportation (trucks), drivers and \ngasoline to support the distribution activities. Thanks to this agreement, resources were optimized and an \nadditional 361 families  benefitted from the food distributions. \n \nThe food parcels distributed were labelled \u201ccomplementary rations\u201d as per Sphere Project standards.

The main challenge identified was the long distance from Asuncion to the \ncommunities and the poor road conditions.  \n \nWater and Sanitation  \nObjective: The risk of waterborne and water related diseases has been reduced through the provision of \nsafe water. \n \nActivities completed:  \n\u2022 Visit to the affected municipalities.  \n\u2022 Coordinate between the PADRU water and sanitation expert and PRC technicians.  \n\u2022 Complete a thorough damage assessment in 94 communities.  \n\u2022 Elaborate a report on assessments gathered in the field.  \n\u2022 Deliver a status report to the communities about the repaired water systems.  \n\u2022 Seek funding to implement proposed course of action.  \n \nImpact: \nThe government of Boquer\u00f3n provided water in some communities and repaired some of the damaged water \nsystems. Additionally, the municipality of Filadelfia repaired the damaged water systems in the communities. \n \nThe PRC prepared an analysis and elaborated a plan of action (PoA) to rehabilitate the water systems in the \ndepartment of Boquer\u00f3n. The RIT member specialized in water and sanitation conducted assessments and \nelaborated a proposal, which was eventually funded by the Inter-American Development Bank. The objective \nis to rehabilitate water systems in eight communities, provide training for maintenance of the water systems \nand distribute a maintenance kit to each community.  \n \nThe following table describes the type of rehabilitation accomplished from December 2008 to February 2009 \nby the Paraguayan Red Cross with funds provided by IADB: \n \nDepartment \nMunicipality \nCommunity \nBeneficiaries \nType of Rehabilitation \naccomplished  \nN\u00b0 of \nFamilies \nN\u00b0 of \nPeople \nBOQUERON \nFILADELFIA \nLa Esquina \n(Ayoreo) \u2013 \nSouthern Zone \n27 \n250 \nThe collected rain water \nsystem \nis \nrehabilitated \n(construction of a 100m2 \nroof \nand \ninstallation \nof \n40,000 litre tanks), 2,000 litre \nwater \nsystem \ncollection \ntanks \nfor \nhomes; \nwater \ntreatment. \nGaray (Ayoreo) \n\u2013 Southern Zone \n20 \n200 \nThe collected rain water \nsystem \nis \nrehabilitated \n(construction of a 100m2 \nroof \nand \ninstallation \nof \n40,000 litre tanks), 2,000 \nlitres water system collection \ntanks \nfor \nhomes; \nwater \ntreatment: \nInstallation \nof \npipes and windmill.  \nLOMA PLATA \nBetania \n(Lengua) \u2013 \nYalve Sanga \n143 \n1,000 \nRepairing \nof \ngutters \nfor \ncollection of water, widening \nof \ncommunity pipes \nand \nwater treatment.  \nJope (Lengua) \u2013 \nYalve Sanga \n74 \n600 \nRepairing \nof \ngutters \nfor \ncollection of water, widening \nof \ncommunity pipes \nand \nwater treatment. \n13 de Agosto \n(Nivacle) \u2013 \nLaguna Negra \n25 \n200 \nSupply of windmill, widening \nof community pipes.

The RIT deployed at the \nbeginning of the emergency will stay for five months (until May 2009) to support and coordinate the activities \nwith the PRC and SEN. This activity was funded by the European Commission\u2019s Humanitarian Aid \nDepartment (ECHO). \n \nConclusion \n \nThis operation strengthened relations among local authorities of Filadelfia, Mcal. Estigarribia, and the \ngovernment of the department of Boquer\u00f3n. The local authorities of Boquer\u00f3n requested constant support \nfrom the local PRC branch as well as the PRC headquarters for the strengthening of disaster response, risk \nmanagement and risk reduction. In addition, the SEN accomplished successful coordination efforts for the \ndistribution of the food parcels and logistical support. The strategic use of DREF funds in this operation led to \nadditional funding opportunities and longer-term programming, including the rehabilitation of water supply \nsystems and supply of equipment through third party funding. \n \nFollowing this emergency, the communities and National Society are more aware of how to confront disaster \nsituations and have learned the importance of increased preparedness in order to reduce risks. Moreover, the \ngovernment of Boquer\u00f3n is in the process of elaborating an institutional strengthening initiative in the area of \nrisk reduction focusing on the Ni\u00f1o phenomena, which will increase awareness among the communities. \n \nIn addition, the DIPECHO - Finnish Red Cross \u2013 International Federation Risk Reduction Project in the region \nof Chaco has been crucial to increase the visibility and credibility of the Paraguayan Red Cross within the \ninvolved communities, especially since the communities were provided with food items.  \n \nHow we work \nAll International Federation assistance seeks to adhere to the Code of Conduct for the \nInternational Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and Non-Governmental Organizations \n(NGO's) in Disaster Relief and is committed to the Humanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards \nin Disaster Response (Sphere) in delivering assistance to the most vulnerable. \n \nThe International Federation\u2019s activities are \naligned with its Global Agenda, which sets \nout four broad goals to meet the Federation's \nmission to \"improve the lives of vulnerable \npeople by mobilizing the power of humanity\". \nGlobal Agenda Goals: \n\u2022 Reduce the numbers of deaths, injuries and impact \nfrom disasters. \n\u2022 Reduce the number of deaths, illnesses and impact \nfrom diseases and public health emergencies. \n\u2022 Increase local community, civil society and Red Cross \nRed Crescent capacity to address the most urgent \nsituations of vulnerability. \n\u2022 Reduce \nintolerance, \ndiscrimination \nand \nsocial \nexclusion and promote respect for diversity and human \ndignity. \nContact information  \nFor further information specifically related to this operation please contact:  \n\u2022 \nIn \nParaguay: \nTeresa \nGamarra, \nParaguayan \nRed \nCross \nProject \nCoordinator; \nemail: \ntgamarra@highway.com.py; phone: (595) 98 239 1737 \n\u2022 \nIn Panama: Ariel Kestens, Head of the Pan American Disaster Response Unit, email: \nariel.kestens@ifrc.org; phone: (507) 316 1001; fax: (507) 316 1082. \n\u2022 \nIn Panama: Jean Pierre Taschereau, Disaster Management Delegate, PADRU; email: \njp.taschereau@ifrc.org; phone: (507) 316 1001; fax: (507) 316 1082  \n\u2022 \nIn Buenos Aires: Gustavo Ramirez, Regional Representation for the Southern Cone; email: \ngustavo.ramirez@ifrc.org;  \n\u2022 \nIn \nPanama: \nMaria \nAlc\u00e1zar, \nResource \nMobilization \nCoordinator, \nAmericas; \nemail: \nmaria.alcazar@ifrc.org; phone: (507) 380 0250; fax: (507) 317 1304.  \n\u2022 \nIn Geneva: Pablo Medina, Operations Coordinator for the Americas; email: pablo.medina@ifrc.org ; \nphone (41) 79 217 3376; fax: (41) 22 730 0395. \n \n<Final financial report below; click here to return to the title page> \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSelected Parameters\nReporting Timeframe\n2008/09-2009/03\nBudget Timeframe\n2008/09-2008/12\nAppeal\nMDRPY005\nBudget\nAPPEAL\nAll figures are in Swiss Francs (CHF)\nFinal Financial Report\nMDRPY005 - Paraguay - Drought\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies\nI.

Many parts \nof Karamoja were described as \nchronically food insecure for the past 5 years due a combination of factors including recurrent drought, \nover population and declining resource base for agro-pastoralist. \n \nA total of 5,000 households (25,000 beneficiaries) who were critically vulnerable from Kotido and Abim \ndistricts were identified amongst the affected population and benefited from the provision of seeds and \nagricultural tools to enable them to cope with food insecurity.  \n \nThis operation was conducted in collaboration with the Government of Uganda, World Food Programme \n(WFP), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and United Nations Childrens\u2019 Fund (UNICEF). The \nmajor donors to the DREF are the Irish, Italian, Netherlands and Norwegian governments and ECHO. \nDetails of all donors can be found on: \nhttp://www.ifrc.org/what/disasters/responding/drs/tools/dref/donors.asp \n \n< Click here for the final financial report or here to view contact details> \n \nURCS FS officer demonstrating a sample of the seed kit to be distributed \nin one of the sensitization meeting in Nakapelimoru Kotido district \n \n2 \n \n \nThe situation \nThe 2008 rains in Karamoja were erratic and caused uncertainty amongst the farming population. For \nexample, in first season of 2008, Abim and Kotido experienced their first rains in late May 2008 while the \nsecond rains came late August 2008. Normal rains for this area are March to June. This confused farmers to \nthe extent that most of them who had seeds could not plant due to uncertainty of the weather conditions. The \nmetrological department predicted a dry season from November 2008 to the end of February 2009.  Worse \nstill, the predicted rains could not come and are expected mid April 2009. The Food security and livelihood \nworking group chaired by Food and Agriculture Organization, and the Office of the Prime Minister in charge \nof disasters, issued an alert that communities in the Karamoja region were likely to starve due to poor \nharvest and late rains.  \n \nAs a consequence of this situation, many Agencies that had planned to distribute seeds had to put this \nactivity on hold until the end of February 2009. The fact that most people in the area still depend on World \nFood Programme food distributions which is not enough and had delayed to reach the URCS targeted \ncommunities, URCS had fears that if the seeds were distributed at this time then it was clear that no planting \nwill take place; the beneficiaries would eat or sell them. However, some preparatory activities were carried \nout (MDRUG01101).  \n \nCoordination and partnerships \nThe Uganda Red Cross Society implemented all project activities in liaison with the relevant Government \ndepartments (at National, District and Sub-county levels), WFP, FAO and United Nations Childrens\u2019 Fund. \nThe East Africa Zone Office also supported the URCS, specifically in the design and implementation of a \ncomprehensive food security assessment in the project area. The Federation supported this project through \nthe provision of the DREF. \n \nThe URCS staffs implementing the project participated in the food security cluster meeting in the area. They \nattended three food security meetings with district production staffs and Food Security and Agricultural \nLivelihood (FSAL) partners in the region. The outcomes of the meeting included: \n\u2022 \nFood shortage in the region which called for WFP to increase food aid to the region. FSAL agencies \nwere expected to plan and stock seeds during dry season in preparation for the planting season \nwhich has delayed due to the prolonged dry spell until April 2009. \n\u2022 \nThe need for a rapid inter-agency food security assessment under the guidance of the District \nProduction Officer (DPO). This was carried out by URCS staff was among other FSAL members to \nanalyse the food security crisis in the area.  \nThe recommendations for the meeting were: The agencies and non governmental organizations (NGOs) that \nhad seeds were required not to distribute them to the farmers because it was felt that the seeds would not be \nplanted and there was fear that the seeds would be washed and eaten given the existing food insecurity in \nthe area. It was also recommended that seed distribution process should always be done concurrently with \nfood for work programme (FWP) so that beneficiaries would have food by the time they receive seeds for \nplanting.  \n \nRed Cross and Red Crescent action \n \nProgress towards objectives \n \nRelief distributions  \nObjective 1: To revive the livelihood options of 5,000 agricultural households, through the \ndistribution of emergency seeds and tools for the first planting season of 2009. \nActivities planned \n\u2022 \nProcurement of planting material (sorghum, maize, beans, cassava and vegetable seed). \n\u2022 \nCarry out community mobilization and sensitization on the   project implementation plan \n(PIP). \n\u2022 \nRegistration and verification of the internally displaced persons in the resettlement camps. \n\u2022 \nFormation of seed committees at parish level.  \n\u2022 \nTransportation and distribution of planting material to target beneficiaries. \n\u2022 \nProcurement and distribution of agricultural tools (hand hoes, machetes, axes, sickles and \nrakes).  \n3 \n \n \n \n \nAchievements \nProcurement, delivery and distribution of the seeds and \ntools for 5,000 beneficiaries was completed. According \nto the National Society, the following items and/or \ninputs were procured and distributed; 3 kgs of \nsorghum, 3kgs of beans, 3kgs of maize and vegetable \nkit (20gms of egg plant, onions, sukuma wiki, \nAmaranths (Dodo) and Okra) as one household kit total \n5,000 kits. The tools procured included: a panga, two \nhoes, a sickle and an axe for one household as one kit. \nDuring the distribution, National Society Central \ngoverning board chairman and Kotido branch board \nmembers attended a meeting organized by the District \nAgriculture officer who sensitized beneficiaries the \nneed to plant on time.  \n \nCommunity mobilization and sensitization was done appropriately through FSAL cluster meetings and \nDistrict Agriculture Officers (DAOs) meetings. The beneficiaries were verified a few days to distribution time \nand they were given them identification cards.  \n \nAt parish level, the seeds committees were formed \nand the members mobilization and sensitized the \ncommunity on seed distribution. Selection of target \nareas in both districts was done in coordination with \nthe District Agriculture Officers, Sub County Extension \nWorkers \nand \nUnited \nNations \nOffice \nfor \nthe \nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN-OCHA) \noffice Kotido districts. The areas supported in this \nintervention were: Nyakwae and Arelek sub counties \nof Abim and Kacheri and Nakapelimoru sub counties \nof Kotido district. Each committee was chaired by the \nParish development committee chair person and \nassisted \nby \nthe \nparish \nchief, \ntwo \nwomen \nrepresentatives who were responsible for cultivation, \nfour local council leader representatives who were \nresponsible for enforcing by-laws, two community \nbased volunteers who were trained on seed \nmanagement and how to write progress reports and \nopinion leader for giving un biased information to those monitoring the project. Their other roles were to \nmobilize farmers to open land and development of nursery beds for vegetable growing. These committees \nalso helped to identify the active beneficiaries and volunteer selection which helped URCS staff to finish their \nwork smoothly. \n \nTwenty two community volunteers were trained for four days in seeds management and livelihoods skills, \nvegetable production skills, Red Cross Movement principles and roles and monitoring and evaluation. These \nCommunity based volunteers (CBVs) were selected with the help of community members and/or leaders in \nNyakwae and Kacheri sub counties. \n \nObjective 2: To conduct baseline survey and collect detailed and up-to-date information on food insecurity \nsituation of the vulnerable people in Abim and Kotido districts for long term Food Security programming. \nActivities planned \n\u2022 Deployment of one food security expert to provide technical support in the baseline (for one \nmonth). \n\u2022 Mobilizing staff and volunteers for baselines survey. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVolunteers distributing seeds and tools in Wilela  \nAlerek Abim district  \n \nATOT trainer demonstrating how to plant seeds in  \na row during seeds mgt training in Kotido district \n headquarters \n \n4 \n \nAchievements \nAn external consultant was assigned to design administer and analyse the data collected from the two \nsampled areas of Nyakwae sub county of Abim and Kacheri sub county of Kotido districts targeting 500 \nhouseholds. With the help of the Federation Eastern African Zone delegate, baseline survey tools were \ndeveloped and used to collect the row data from the selected areas after orienting selected volunteers at the \nfield level that were used to collect data. Information at household level, Key informants and secondary data \nwas successfully collected.  \n \nThe URCS staffs worked in conjunction with the selected external consultant. The consultant selected and \noriented the volunteers on project activities. The volunteers were trained on data collection techniques using \nthe local language but interpreting it in English language. The final household baseline survey report was \nsubmitted to the East Africa Zone Office. Based on this report, the National Society finalized the Long Term \nFood Security Programme proposal for 2009 to 2012 period.  \n \nChallenges \nThe project ought to have ended by December 2008, however, it was delayed due to weather conditions, \nand as a result URCS had to extend the operation. This impacted negatively on the already planned budget. \nAnother challenge experienced during the course of this project was the inadequate logistical services \nespecially hotels this led to an increase of transport costs. Shortage of food led to delays since the URCS \nhad to wait for WFP to first distribute food due to fear of beneficiaries eating seeds as a result of hunger \nirrespective of sensitization of the treated seeds. There was also an overwhelming demand of seeds since \nthe URCS had to distribute seeds to one parish and were the first to distribute before FAO. This challenged \nwas later solved as other agencies came on board to fill the gap. \n \nConclusion \nThis operation was completed successfully. The URCS applauds the Federation for accepting the DREF \nextension that gave URCS an opportunity to distribute the seeds at the right time. The URCS also \ncommends the food security and livelihood cluster who provided guidance at the time of community \nselection and URCS volunteers and staff for their commitment who worked hard to deliver seeds and tools in \ntime. The objectives of this operation were achieved, hence the URCS are looking forward to community \nvolunteers conducting crop performance evaluation.  \n \nHow we work \nAll International Federation assistance seeks to adhere to the Code of Conduct for the \nInternational Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and Non-Governmental Organizations \n(NGO's) in Disaster Relief and is committed to the Humanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards \nin Disaster Response (Sphere) in delivering assistance to the most vulnerable. \n \nThe International Federation\u2019s activities are \naligned with its Global Agenda, which sets \nout four broad goals to meet the Federation's \nmission to \"improve the lives of vulnerable \npeople by mobilizing the power of humanity\". \nGlobal Agenda Goals: \n\u2022 Reduce the numbers of deaths, injuries and impact \nfrom disasters. \n\u2022 Reduce the number of deaths, illnesses and impact \nfrom diseases and public health emergencies. \n\u2022 Increase local community, civil society and Red Cross \nRed Crescent capacity to address the most urgent \nsituations of vulnerability. \n\u2022 Reduce \nintolerance, \ndiscrimination \nand \nsocial \nexclusion and promote respect for diversity and human \ndignity. \nContact information  \nFor further information specifically related to this operation please contact:  \n\u2022 \nIn Uganda: Michael Nataka, Secretary General, Uganda Red Cross Society, Kampala, Email: \nnatakam@redcrossug.org; telephone: +256 41 258 701/2; fax: +256 41 258 184 \n\u2022 \nIn Kenya: Nancy Balfour, Disaster Management Coordinator Eastern Africa Zone, Nairobi; email: \n5 \n \nnancy.balfour@ifrc.org; telephone: +254.20.283.5208; fax +254.20.271.2777  \n\u2022 \nIn Kenya: Dr. Asha Mohammed, Federation Eastern Africa Zone, Nairobi, phone: \n+54.20.283.51.24; Fax: + 254.20.271.27.77; email: asha.mohammed@ifrc.org  \n\u2022 \nIn Geneva: Pablo Medina, Operations Coordinator for Eastern Africa; phone: +41.22.730.43.81; \nfax: +41 22 733 0395; email: pablo.medina@ifrc.org \n \n<Final financial report below; click here to return to the title page> \nSelected Parameters\nReporting Timeframe\n2008/9-2009/6\nBudget Timeframe\n2008/9-2008/12\nAppeal\nMDRUG011\nBudget\nAPPEAL\nAll figures are in Swiss Francs (CHF)\nFinal Financial Report\nMDRUG011 - Uganda - Food Insecurity\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies\nI.

The DREF is a vital part of the International Federation\u2019s \ndisaster response system and increases the ability of national societies to respond to disasters. \nSummary: CHF 200,961 (USD 193,232 or \nEUR \n124,434) \nwas \nallocated \nfrom \nthe \nFederation\u2019s Disaster Relief Emergency Fund \n(DREF) on 1 July 2008 to support the Kenya \nRed Cross Society (KRCS) in delivering \nemergency food assistance to some 87,092 \nbeneficiaries. \n \nA total of 926.56 metric tonnes of relief food \nwas distributed to 123,314 beneficiaries in the \ndrought stricken districts of Baringo and East \nPokot in the Rift Valley Province. A mobile \nhealth clinic also attended to 906 patients, \nwhile 534 children under the age of 5 years \nwere screened for malnutrition.  \n \nThis operation was conducted in collaboration \nwith the Kenyan Government Ministry of Water, \nArid Lands Resource Management Project \n(ALRMP) and World Vision.  \n \n<click here for the final financial report or here to view contact details> \n \n \nThe situation \nThe northwestern pastoral areas of Kenya faced an acute food and livelihood crisis due to a combination of \nlivestock diseases, below normal rainfall and ethnic conflict. The Districts of Baringo and East Pokot were \nparticularly hit hard by drought and were in need of emergency food assistance. Assessments conducted by \nthe KRCS identified 87,092 persons as facing starvation. The impact of malnutrition, in addition to other \nhealth issues such as respiratory diseases, malaria and skin diseases, also presented a need for emergency \nhealth care.   \n \n \nKenya Red Cross Public Health Officer conducting a medical  \nexamination on a child.\n \n2\nCoordination and partnerships \nArid Lands Resource Management Programme was involved in mitigating the effects of drought by \nundertaking the following measures: Construction of tank and installation of a pump for Kolowa water project; \nconstruction of roof rain harvesting tank for Kamurio primary school; excavation of Kapsipeiwa water pan in \nKipsaraman division and Cheporuswo water pan in Marigat division; laying pipes and tank construction for \nKarimadow borehole in Churo division; solar fencing of farms in Lemuye community in East Pokot; water \nharvesting and irrigation in Chesirimion, Mondi division; laying pipes for Tangulbei borehole in collaboration \nwith the Ministry of Water; conducting soil conservation measures in Seretion community and equipping of \nKapturo dispensary in Bartabwa division. \n \nWorld Vision undertook a water project in Ewalel Soi Location that included extension of water supply line \nand construction of communal masonry tanks as the area had no access to piped water \n \nRed Cross and Red Crescent action \nAfter completing an initial detailed assessment of the drought situation and the impact on the districts, the \nKRCS initiated a relief response consisting of emergency food distribution and health care. KRCS \nsuccessfully mobilized and transported relief supplies and engaged local volunteers in the two affected \ndistricts. Distribution sites were set up in various villages in order to reach targeted beneficiaries and \nultimately reached an additional 35,000 beneficiaries. A mobile clinic travelled through the districts setting up \nin four villages and providing desperately needed medical attention. Children were screened for malnutrition \nand provided with appropriate medical attention such as vitamin A supplements and corn soy blend (CSB). \n \nProgress towards objectives \n \nRelief distributions (food and basic non-food items)  \nObjective 1: Provide emergency assistance to 87,092 people (14,515 families) affected by drought in \nWest Pokot and Baringo Districts. \n \nActivities planned \n\u2022 \nOne-off distribution of relief food (cereals, pulses, vegetable oil and unimix). \n \nAchievements \nIn Baringo District, Kenya Red Cross Society distributed 442.58MT of relief food, which included cereals, \npulses, vegetable oil and unimix. The food was distributed to a population of 58,993 people during the \noperation. \n \nIn East Pokot District, Kenya Red Cross Society distributed 483.98MT of relief food which included cereals, \npulses, vegetable oil and unimix. This was distributed to a population of 64,321 people during the operation.  \n \nObjective 2: To contribute to the reduction of mortality and morbidity related to communicable \ndiseases. \n \nActivities planned \n\u2022 \nSupport the implementation of medical outreach in areas with poor access to health facilities, which \nwill include treatment of common ailments, immunization, supplementation and deworming. \n \nAchievements \nChesirimion (Mondi Division) - A mobile clinic was held at Chesirimion Primary School on 2 August 2008. \nThe total number of patients attended to were 137 and no referrals were made. The disease morbidity for the \ntop four diseases were as follows: respiratory diseases (38.7 percent), malaria (13.4 percent), skin diseases \n(11.3 percent) and rheumatism and/or joint pains (7.7 percent). \n    \nIn nutrition care, a total of 70 children under 5 years were screened (see table 1 below). \n  \nTable 1: Number of children under 5 years in Chesirimion screened for nutrition care \n \nNutritional status \nNumber of Cases \nPercentage \nSeverely malnourished                    \n6\n8.5\nModerately malnourished                \n19\n27.1\nAt risk and/or mild malnutrition        \n28\n40\nNormal nutrition status                     \n17\n24.2\n \n3\n \nThe severe and moderately malnourished persons were issued with corn soy blend and vitamin A \nsupplement.

At least 71 \nmosquito nets were distributed to pregnant and lactating mothers. \n \nChallenges \nThe challenges identified during the course of this project included: Inadequate nutritional supplements such \nas CSB and energy biscuits to improve the nutritional status of malnourished children; inadequate staff to \ncope with the large number of patients attending clinic for medical services; rough terrain and lack of bridges \nmade some areas inaccessible for mobile clinics; language barrier called for constant translation thus \nslowing down the activities; breakdown and late arrival of trucks due to poor inaccessible road network; loss \nof food as a result of spillages and lack of storage facilities in the community; poor communication network \ninterfered with coordination of the operation; interference from community leaders and politicians during food \ndistribution and late arrival of beneficiaries at distribution points due to vast distances of trekking. \n \n \nConclusion \nThere is need to strengthen KRCS presence in Baringo through additional volunteer recruitment, this will \nfacilitate interventions targeting the vulnerable members. KRCS need to enhance preparedness measures \nthrough early pre-positioning of relief food and other items in the region. There is a need to strength \ncommunication system through installation of radios in all vehicles as well as improving road networks. There \nis also a need to initiate risk reduction, long term recovery and livelihood programmes in the area to reduce \ntheir levels of vulnerability. \n \nHow we work \nAll International Federation assistance seeks to adhere to the Code of Conduct for the \nInternational Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and Non-Governmental Organizations \n(NGO's) in Disaster Relief and is committed to the Humanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards \nin Disaster Response (Sphere) in delivering assistance to the most vulnerable. \n \nThe International Federation\u2019s activities are \naligned with its

The DREF is a vital part of the \nInternational Federation\u2019s disaster response system and increases the ability of national societies \nto respond to disasters. \n \nSummary: CHF 93,000 (USD 84,545 or EUR \n57,585)  was allocated from the Federation\u2019s \nDisaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) to \nsupport \nthe \nParaguayan \nRed \nCross \nin \ndelivering immediate food assistance to 1,261 \nindigenous families in the department of \nBoquer\u00f3n. \n \nWith the aim of reducing the impact caused by \nthis natural phenomenon which requires the \nimplementation \nof \nurgent \nmeasures \nand \nprogrammes to reduce the vulnerability of the \npopulation and of the indigenous communities, \nthe National Government, by Decree of the \nExecutive Authority N\u00ba 229 of 10 September \n2008, declared an Emergency Situation for a \nperiod of 90 days for the departments of Alto \nParaguay, Boquer\u00f3n and Presidente Hayes \nthat were affected by a prolonged drought.  \n \nThe \nNational \nEmergency \nSecretariat \n(Secretar\u00eda de Emergencia Nacional - SEN) \nelaborated a plan of action to respond to this \nsituation, entitling this \u201cEl Chaco needs us\u201d (El \nChaco nos necesita), with the express purpose \nof working in coordination with public and \nprivate \ninstitutions \nand \nthe \ninternational \ncommunity along six strategic lines.  \n \nThe Paraguayan Red Cross (PRC) deployed \nan assessment team for one week to the \ndepartment of Boquer\u00f3n.  The team worked jointly with government officials from the department of \nBoquer\u00f3n and with local government branches in the municipalities of Filadelfia and Mariscal Estigarribia, \ncarrying out damage and need assessments as well as identification of families affected by the drought.  \nThe International Federation, through its Pan American Disaster Response Unit (PADRU) and the \nRegional Representation for the Andean Region, provided support to the PRC from the outset of the \nemergency. A Regional Intervention Team (RIT) member specialized in water and sanitation was \ndeployed to Paraguay for one month to provide technical support for the operation.  The Agency for \nInternational Development of the United States government (USAID) channelled emergency funds for \nassisting families in the Department of Boquer\u00f3n. Other organizations including the Inter-American \nDevelopment Bank (IADB) and the European Commission\u2019s Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO) provided \nfunds to rehabilitate water systems. Additionally, the Italian government replenished DREF in the amount \nof CHF 80,750.  \n \n<Click here for the final financial report, or here to view contact details> \n \nThe situation \n \nThe Central Region of Chaco covers 60 per cent of the country and includes the departments of Alto \nParaguay, Boquer\u00f3n and Presidente Hayes. The region of Chaco has significant climatic variations and \nunique geological characteristics that create a great variety of ecological phenomena including plains, dry \nsavannas \u2014that seasonally flood\u2014, swamplands and extensive forests and brush land. One of the major \nproblems this area faces is the extreme cyclical droughts and flooding. According to the Nature \nConservancy, the river water levels in the mountain range area during the rainy season reach very high \npeaks and diminish dramatically during the dry season. The sustainability of agriculture is severely impacted \nby these drastic changes as the soil becomes highly impermeable causing floods during the rainy season \nwhile during dry season the soil becomes sandy with poor nutrients.  \n \nAdditionally, the local population comprises mainly small-scale farmers and indigenous communities which \nface severe socio-economic challenges such as poverty, low wages, chronic malnutrition and low food \nsupply, compounded by environmental concerns such as deforestation, general degradation of soil \nproductivity and scarcity of water. The territorial and socio-economic framework of the region indicates that \nmost of these impacts are frequently under-reported or they do not receive visibility at the international level, \na phenomenon regularly known as \u201csilent disasters\u201d. \n \nNotably, more than 60 per cent of the population is living below the poverty line and the most vulnerable are \nthe indigenous communities that do not have enough land to cultivate and generate the income to afford \nbasic necessities. The prolonged drought has deteriorated the population\u2019s basic subsistence as \ncommunities have temporarily lost the ability to produce their own food and secure their own water supply. \n \nAccording to SEN, health reports indicate high levels of respiratory and flu-like symptoms due to the drastic \nweather changes and the presence of constant strong winds coming in from the north. In addition, \nundernourishment due to the low food supply has caused the death of six children and low school \nperformance. \n \nRed Cross and Red Crescent action \n \nSince the beginning of the emergency, the Paraguayan Red Cross activated its local and central response \nteams. A National Intervention Team (NIT) was deployed along with a volunteer trained as a RIT member \nspecialized in information and reporting to support the local PRC branch in Boquer\u00f3n. The team was jointly \ncoordinating the gathering of information with the local authorities of Boquer\u00f3n and sub-authorities of \nFiladelfia, Loma Plata and Mcal. Estigarribia. A plan of action was drawn up in coordination with the Pan \nAmerican Disaster Response Unit in Panama. In addition, a water and sanitation specialist was deployed for \none month with the objective of completing an exhaustive and complete diagnosis of the potable water \nsupply systems in the department of Boquer\u00f3n. \n \nThe local branches have worked actively since the beginning of the year in risk management processes at \ndepartmental level through a Preparedness and Multi-Hazard Risk Reduction Project financed by ECHO \n(DIPECHO-V). The branches activated all processes with actors involved as established within the \nframework of the project. \n \nThe PRC mobilized technical personnel, disaster response specialists with expertise in logistics, purchasing, \nhealth and administration. The Paraguayan Red Cross also utilized the PRC volunteer work in the \nintervention and worked in close coordination with SEN.  \n \nThe support provided by the local branches and team members from the department of Boquer\u00f3n in guiding \nand directing the actions has been invaluable. Risk management processes have been enhanced and  \ncoordinated response actions with the Emergency Operations Centre located in Cruce Los Pioneros, Chaco \nwere made possible thanks to their efforts. \n \nThe Paraguayan government supported PRC activities by providing fuel in order to access some \ncommunities. Since the beginning of the emergency the government has been assisting the National Society \nwith resources including a vehicle and personnel to carry out the distribution activities.   \nProgress towards objectives \n \nRelief distributions (food items)  \nObjective: To assist 900 of the most vulnerable families in the departments of Boquer\u00f3n with \nhumanitarian aid consisting of supplementary food items.  \nActivities completed: \n\u2022 \nRevision of community list.  \n\u2022 \nList update after field visits (visits to each potential beneficiary family).  \n\u2022 \nPreparation of distribution tables.  \n\u2022 \nLocal procurement of food items.  \n\u2022 \nPackaging and labelling of food parcels.  \n\u2022 \nElaboration and updating census with government listings. \n\u2022 \nOrganization of volunteer groups. \n\u2022 \nOrganization with community leaders to notify distributions.  \n\u2022 \nMobilization and delivery of food parcels to each family (with signature of each head of family).  \n \nThe criteria for selection of the beneficiary families focused on indigenous families affected by the drought in \nthe department of Boquer\u00f3n. Mobilization and delivery of food parcels to each family (with signature of each \nhead of family and or community leader representative), are carried out according to distribution charts made \nafter a census was completed in the beneficiary communities. Communities received food parcels after \npresenting proper identification.  Due to the drought season the indigenous communities were affected with \nlack of water. As a result family\u2019s food intake was reduced from three daily meals to one meal a day; \ntherefore affecting their health. During the last phase, there was a noticeable improvement in the quality of \nlife of the affected people thanks to the food items distributed, which followed Sphere standards (increasing \nnutritional conditions). Consequently, health conditions improved, especially among children and the elderly \nwho are the most vulnerable. \n \nImpact:  \nThe plan of action initially contemplated distribution of a 47 kg. food parcel to 900 families in the indigenous \ncommunities of the department of Boquer\u00f3n for a period of one month.   \n \nAn agreement was reached with the SEN, where the SEN would provide transportation (trucks), drivers and \ngasoline to support the distribution activities. Thanks to this agreement, resources were optimized and an \nadditional 361 families  benefitted from the food distributions. \n \nThe food parcels distributed were labelled \u201ccomplementary rations\u201d as per Sphere Project standards.

The main challenge identified was the long distance from Asuncion to the \ncommunities and the poor road conditions.  \n \nWater and Sanitation  \nObjective: The risk of waterborne and water related diseases has been reduced through the provision of \nsafe water. \n \nActivities completed:  \n\u2022 Visit to the affected municipalities.  \n\u2022 Coordinate between the PADRU water and sanitation expert and PRC technicians.  \n\u2022 Complete a thorough damage assessment in 94 communities.  \n\u2022 Elaborate a report on assessments gathered in the field.  \n\u2022 Deliver a status report to the communities about the repaired water systems.  \n\u2022 Seek funding to implement proposed course of action.  \n \nImpact: \nThe government of Boquer\u00f3n provided water in some communities and repaired some of the damaged water \nsystems. Additionally, the municipality of Filadelfia repaired the damaged water systems in the communities. \n \nThe PRC prepared an analysis and elaborated a plan of action (PoA) to rehabilitate the water systems in the \ndepartment of Boquer\u00f3n. The RIT member specialized in water and sanitation conducted assessments and \nelaborated a proposal, which was eventually funded by the Inter-American Development Bank. The objective \nis to rehabilitate water systems in eight communities, provide training for maintenance of the water systems \nand distribute a maintenance kit to each community.  \n \nThe following table describes the type of rehabilitation accomplished from December 2008 to February 2009 \nby the Paraguayan Red Cross with funds provided by IADB: \n \nDepartment \nMunicipality \nCommunity \nBeneficiaries \nType of Rehabilitation \naccomplished  \nN\u00b0 of \nFamilies \nN\u00b0 of \nPeople \nBOQUERON \nFILADELFIA \nLa Esquina \n(Ayoreo) \u2013 \nSouthern Zone \n27 \n250 \nThe collected rain water \nsystem \nis \nrehabilitated \n(construction of a 100m2 \nroof \nand \ninstallation \nof \n40,000 litre tanks), 2,000 litre \nwater \nsystem \ncollection \ntanks \nfor \nhomes; \nwater \ntreatment. \nGaray (Ayoreo) \n\u2013 Southern Zone \n20 \n200 \nThe collected rain water \nsystem \nis \nrehabilitated \n(construction of a 100m2 \nroof \nand \ninstallation \nof \n40,000 litre tanks), 2,000 \nlitres water system collection \ntanks \nfor \nhomes; \nwater \ntreatment: \nInstallation \nof \npipes and windmill.  \nLOMA PLATA \nBetania \n(Lengua) \u2013 \nYalve Sanga \n143 \n1,000 \nRepairing \nof \ngutters \nfor \ncollection of water, widening \nof \ncommunity pipes \nand \nwater treatment.  \nJope (Lengua) \u2013 \nYalve Sanga \n74 \n600 \nRepairing \nof \ngutters \nfor \ncollection of water, widening \nof \ncommunity pipes \nand \nwater treatment. \n13 de Agosto \n(Nivacle) \u2013 \nLaguna Negra \n25 \n200 \nSupply of windmill, widening \nof community pipes.

The RIT deployed at the \nbeginning of the emergency will stay for five months (until May 2009) to support and coordinate the activities \nwith the PRC and SEN. This activity was funded by the European Commission\u2019s Humanitarian Aid \nDepartment (ECHO). \n \nConclusion \n \nThis operation strengthened relations among local authorities of Filadelfia, Mcal. Estigarribia, and the \ngovernment of the department of Boquer\u00f3n. The local authorities of Boquer\u00f3n requested constant support \nfrom the local PRC branch as well as the PRC headquarters for the strengthening of disaster response, risk \nmanagement and risk reduction. In addition, the SEN accomplished successful coordination efforts for the \ndistribution of the food parcels and logistical support. The strategic use of DREF funds in this operation led to \nadditional funding opportunities and longer-term programming, including the rehabilitation of water supply \nsystems and supply of equipment through third party funding. \n \nFollowing this emergency, the communities and National Society are more aware of how to confront disaster \nsituations and have learned the importance of increased preparedness in order to reduce risks. Moreover, the \ngovernment of Boquer\u00f3n is in the process of elaborating an institutional strengthening initiative in the area of \nrisk reduction focusing on the Ni\u00f1o phenomena, which will increase awareness among the communities. \n \nIn addition, the DIPECHO - Finnish Red Cross \u2013 International Federation Risk Reduction Project in the region \nof Chaco has been crucial to increase the visibility and credibility of the Paraguayan Red Cross within the \ninvolved communities, especially since the communities were provided with food items.  \n \nHow we work \nAll International Federation assistance seeks to adhere to the Code of Conduct for the \nInternational Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and Non-Governmental Organizations \n(NGO's) in Disaster Relief and is committed to the Humanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards \nin Disaster Response (Sphere) in delivering assistance to the most vulnerable. \n \nThe International Federation\u2019s activities are \naligned with its Global Agenda, which sets \nout four broad goals to meet the Federation's \nmission to \"improve the lives of vulnerable \npeople by mobilizing the power of humanity\". \nGlobal Agenda Goals: \n\u2022 Reduce the numbers of deaths, injuries and impact \nfrom disasters. \n\u2022 Reduce the number of deaths, illnesses and impact \nfrom diseases and public health emergencies. \n\u2022 Increase local community, civil society and Red Cross \nRed Crescent capacity to address the most urgent \nsituations of vulnerability. \n\u2022 Reduce \nintolerance, \ndiscrimination \nand \nsocial \nexclusion and promote respect for diversity and human \ndignity. \nContact information  \nFor further information specifically related to this operation please contact:  \n\u2022 \nIn \nParaguay: \nTeresa \nGamarra, \nParaguayan \nRed \nCross \nProject \nCoordinator; \nemail: \ntgamarra@highway.com.py; phone: (595) 98 239 1737 \n\u2022 \nIn Panama: Ariel Kestens, Head of the Pan American Disaster Response Unit, email: \nariel.kestens@ifrc.org; phone: (507) 316 1001; fax: (507) 316 1082. \n\u2022 \nIn Panama: Jean Pierre Taschereau, Disaster Management Delegate, PADRU; email: \njp.taschereau@ifrc.org; phone: (507) 316 1001; fax: (507) 316 1082  \n\u2022 \nIn Buenos Aires: Gustavo Ramirez, Regional Representation for the Southern Cone; email: \ngustavo.ramirez@ifrc.org;  \n\u2022 \nIn \nPanama: \nMaria \nAlc\u00e1zar, \nResource \nMobilization \nCoordinator, \nAmericas; \nemail: \nmaria.alcazar@ifrc.org; phone: (507) 380 0250; fax: (507) 317 1304.  \n\u2022 \nIn Geneva: Pablo Medina, Operations Coordinator for the Americas; email: pablo.medina@ifrc.org ; \nphone (41) 79 217 3376; fax: (41) 22 730 0395. \n \n<Final financial report below; click here to return to the title page> \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSelected Parameters\nReporting Timeframe\n2008/09-2009/03\nBudget Timeframe\n2008/09-2008/12\nAppeal\nMDRPY005\nBudget\nAPPEAL\nAll figures are in Swiss Francs (CHF)\nFinal Financial Report\nMDRPY005 - Paraguay - Drought\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies\nI.

The DREF is a vital part of the \nInternational Federation\u2019s disaster response system and increases the ability of national societies \nto respond to disasters. \n \nSummary: CHF 93,000 (USD 84,545 or EUR \n57,585)  was allocated from the Federation\u2019s \nDisaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) to \nsupport \nthe \nParaguayan \nRed \nCross \nin \ndelivering immediate food assistance to 1,261 \nindigenous families in the department of \nBoquer\u00f3n. \n \nWith the aim of reducing the impact caused by \nthis natural phenomenon which requires the \nimplementation \nof \nurgent \nmeasures \nand \nprogrammes to reduce the vulnerability of the \npopulation and of the indigenous communities, \nthe National Government, by Decree of the \nExecutive Authority N\u00ba 229 of 10 September \n2008, declared an Emergency Situation for a \nperiod of 90 days for the departments of Alto \nParaguay, Boquer\u00f3n and Presidente Hayes \nthat were affected by a prolonged drought.  \n \nThe \nNational \nEmergency \nSecretariat \n(Secretar\u00eda de Emergencia Nacional - SEN) \nelaborated a plan of action to respond to this \nsituation, entitling this \u201cEl Chaco needs us\u201d (El \nChaco nos necesita), with the express purpose \nof working in coordination with public and \nprivate \ninstitutions \nand \nthe \ninternational \ncommunity along six strategic lines.  \n \nThe Paraguayan Red Cross (PRC) deployed \nan assessment team for one week to the \ndepartment of Boquer\u00f3n.  The team worked jointly with government officials from the department of \nBoquer\u00f3n and with local government branches in the municipalities of Filadelfia and Mariscal Estigarribia, \ncarrying out damage and need assessments as well as identification of families affected by the drought.  \nThe International Federation, through its Pan American Disaster Response Unit (PADRU) and the \nRegional Representation for the Andean Region, provided support to the PRC from the outset of the \nemergency. A Regional Intervention Team (RIT) member specialized in water and sanitation was \ndeployed to Paraguay for one month to provide technical support for the operation.  The Agency for \nInternational Development of the United States government (USAID) channelled emergency funds for \nassisting families in the Department of Boquer\u00f3n. Other organizations including the Inter-American \nDevelopment Bank (IADB) and the European Commission\u2019s Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO) provided \nfunds to rehabilitate water systems. Additionally, the Italian government replenished DREF in the amount \nof CHF 80,750.  \n \n<Click here for the final financial report, or here to view contact details> \n \nThe situation \n \nThe Central Region of Chaco covers 60 per cent of the country and includes the departments of Alto \nParaguay, Boquer\u00f3n and Presidente Hayes. The region of Chaco has significant climatic variations and \nunique geological characteristics that create a great variety of ecological phenomena including plains, dry \nsavannas \u2014that seasonally flood\u2014, swamplands and extensive forests and brush land. One of the major \nproblems this area faces is the extreme cyclical droughts and flooding. According to the Nature \nConservancy, the river water levels in the mountain range area during the rainy season reach very high \npeaks and diminish dramatically during the dry season. The sustainability of agriculture is severely impacted \nby these drastic changes as the soil becomes highly impermeable causing floods during the rainy season \nwhile during dry season the soil becomes sandy with poor nutrients.  \n \nAdditionally, the local population comprises mainly small-scale farmers and indigenous communities which \nface severe socio-economic challenges such as poverty, low wages, chronic malnutrition and low food \nsupply, compounded by environmental concerns such as deforestation, general degradation of soil \nproductivity and scarcity of water. The territorial and socio-economic framework of the region indicates that \nmost of these impacts are frequently under-reported or they do not receive visibility at the international level, \na phenomenon regularly known as \u201csilent disasters\u201d. \n \nNotably, more than 60 per cent of the population is living below the poverty line and the most vulnerable are \nthe indigenous communities that do not have enough land to cultivate and generate the income to afford \nbasic necessities. The prolonged drought has deteriorated the population\u2019s basic subsistence as \ncommunities have temporarily lost the ability to produce their own food and secure their own water supply. \n \nAccording to SEN, health reports indicate high levels of respiratory and flu-like symptoms due to the drastic \nweather changes and the presence of constant strong winds coming in from the north. In addition, \nundernourishment due to the low food supply has caused the death of six children and low school \nperformance. \n \nRed Cross and Red Crescent action \n \nSince the beginning of the emergency, the Paraguayan Red Cross activated its local and central response \nteams. A National Intervention Team (NIT) was deployed along with a volunteer trained as a RIT member \nspecialized in information and reporting to support the local PRC branch in Boquer\u00f3n. The team was jointly \ncoordinating the gathering of information with the local authorities of Boquer\u00f3n and sub-authorities of \nFiladelfia, Loma Plata and Mcal. Estigarribia. A plan of action was drawn up in coordination with the Pan \nAmerican Disaster Response Unit in Panama. In addition, a water and sanitation specialist was deployed for \none month with the objective of completing an exhaustive and complete diagnosis of the potable water \nsupply systems in the department of Boquer\u00f3n. \n \nThe local branches have worked actively since the beginning of the year in risk management processes at \ndepartmental level through a Preparedness and Multi-Hazard Risk Reduction Project financed by ECHO \n(DIPECHO-V). The branches activated all processes with actors involved as established within the \nframework of the project. \n \nThe PRC mobilized technical personnel, disaster response specialists with expertise in logistics, purchasing, \nhealth and administration. The Paraguayan Red Cross also utilized the PRC volunteer work in the \nintervention and worked in close coordination with SEN.  \n \nThe support provided by the local branches and team members from the department of Boquer\u00f3n in guiding \nand directing the actions has been invaluable. Risk management processes have been enhanced and  \ncoordinated response actions with the Emergency Operations Centre located in Cruce Los Pioneros, Chaco \nwere made possible thanks to their efforts. \n \nThe Paraguayan government supported PRC activities by providing fuel in order to access some \ncommunities. Since the beginning of the emergency the government has been assisting the National Society \nwith resources including a vehicle and personnel to carry out the distribution activities.   \nProgress towards objectives \n \nRelief distributions (food items)  \nObjective: To assist 900 of the most vulnerable families in the departments of Boquer\u00f3n with \nhumanitarian aid consisting of supplementary food items.  \nActivities completed: \n\u2022 \nRevision of community list.  \n\u2022 \nList update after field visits (visits to each potential beneficiary family).  \n\u2022 \nPreparation of distribution tables.  \n\u2022 \nLocal procurement of food items.  \n\u2022 \nPackaging and labelling of food parcels.  \n\u2022 \nElaboration and updating census with government listings. \n\u2022 \nOrganization of volunteer groups. \n\u2022 \nOrganization with community leaders to notify distributions.  \n\u2022 \nMobilization and delivery of food parcels to each family (with signature of each head of family).  \n \nThe criteria for selection of the beneficiary families focused on indigenous families affected by the drought in \nthe department of Boquer\u00f3n. Mobilization and delivery of food parcels to each family (with signature of each \nhead of family and or community leader representative), are carried out according to distribution charts made \nafter a census was completed in the beneficiary communities. Communities received food parcels after \npresenting proper identification.  Due to the drought season the indigenous communities were affected with \nlack of water. As a result family\u2019s food intake was reduced from three daily meals to one meal a day; \ntherefore affecting their health. During the last phase, there was a noticeable improvement in the quality of \nlife of the affected people thanks to the food items distributed, which followed Sphere standards (increasing \nnutritional conditions). Consequently, health conditions improved, especially among children and the elderly \nwho are the most vulnerable. \n \nImpact:  \nThe plan of action initially contemplated distribution of a 47 kg. food parcel to 900 families in the indigenous \ncommunities of the department of Boquer\u00f3n for a period of one month.   \n \nAn agreement was reached with the SEN, where the SEN would provide transportation (trucks), drivers and \ngasoline to support the distribution activities. Thanks to this agreement, resources were optimized and an \nadditional 361 families  benefitted from the food distributions. \n \nThe food parcels distributed were labelled \u201ccomplementary rations\u201d as per Sphere Project standards.

The main challenge identified was the long distance from Asuncion to the \ncommunities and the poor road conditions.  \n \nWater and Sanitation  \nObjective: The risk of waterborne and water related diseases has been reduced through the provision of \nsafe water. \n \nActivities completed:  \n\u2022 Visit to the affected municipalities.  \n\u2022 Coordinate between the PADRU water and sanitation expert and PRC technicians.  \n\u2022 Complete a thorough damage assessment in 94 communities.  \n\u2022 Elaborate a report on assessments gathered in the field.  \n\u2022 Deliver a status report to the communities about the repaired water systems.  \n\u2022 Seek funding to implement proposed course of action.  \n \nImpact: \nThe government of Boquer\u00f3n provided water in some communities and repaired some of the damaged water \nsystems. Additionally, the municipality of Filadelfia repaired the damaged water systems in the communities. \n \nThe PRC prepared an analysis and elaborated a plan of action (PoA) to rehabilitate the water systems in the \ndepartment of Boquer\u00f3n. The RIT member specialized in water and sanitation conducted assessments and \nelaborated a proposal, which was eventually funded by the Inter-American Development Bank. The objective \nis to rehabilitate water systems in eight communities, provide training for maintenance of the water systems \nand distribute a maintenance kit to each community.  \n \nThe following table describes the type of rehabilitation accomplished from December 2008 to February 2009 \nby the Paraguayan Red Cross with funds provided by IADB: \n \nDepartment \nMunicipality \nCommunity \nBeneficiaries \nType of Rehabilitation \naccomplished  \nN\u00b0 of \nFamilies \nN\u00b0 of \nPeople \nBOQUERON \nFILADELFIA \nLa Esquina \n(Ayoreo) \u2013 \nSouthern Zone \n27 \n250 \nThe collected rain water \nsystem \nis \nrehabilitated \n(construction of a 100m2 \nroof \nand \ninstallation \nof \n40,000 litre tanks), 2,000 litre \nwater \nsystem \ncollection \ntanks \nfor \nhomes; \nwater \ntreatment. \nGaray (Ayoreo) \n\u2013 Southern Zone \n20 \n200 \nThe collected rain water \nsystem \nis \nrehabilitated \n(construction of a 100m2 \nroof \nand \ninstallation \nof \n40,000 litre tanks), 2,000 \nlitres water system collection \ntanks \nfor \nhomes; \nwater \ntreatment: \nInstallation \nof \npipes and windmill.  \nLOMA PLATA \nBetania \n(Lengua) \u2013 \nYalve Sanga \n143 \n1,000 \nRepairing \nof \ngutters \nfor \ncollection of water, widening \nof \ncommunity pipes \nand \nwater treatment.  \nJope (Lengua) \u2013 \nYalve Sanga \n74 \n600 \nRepairing \nof \ngutters \nfor \ncollection of water, widening \nof \ncommunity pipes \nand \nwater treatment. \n13 de Agosto \n(Nivacle) \u2013 \nLaguna Negra \n25 \n200 \nSupply of windmill, widening \nof community pipes.

The RIT deployed at the \nbeginning of the emergency will stay for five months (until May 2009) to support and coordinate the activities \nwith the PRC and SEN. This activity was funded by the European Commission\u2019s Humanitarian Aid \nDepartment (ECHO). \n \nConclusion \n \nThis operation strengthened relations among local authorities of Filadelfia, Mcal. Estigarribia, and the \ngovernment of the department of Boquer\u00f3n. The local authorities of Boquer\u00f3n requested constant support \nfrom the local PRC branch as well as the PRC headquarters for the strengthening of disaster response, risk \nmanagement and risk reduction. In addition, the SEN accomplished successful coordination efforts for the \ndistribution of the food parcels and logistical support. The strategic use of DREF funds in this operation led to \nadditional funding opportunities and longer-term programming, including the rehabilitation of water supply \nsystems and supply of equipment through third party funding. \n \nFollowing this emergency, the communities and National Society are more aware of how to confront disaster \nsituations and have learned the importance of increased preparedness in order to reduce risks. Moreover, the \ngovernment of Boquer\u00f3n is in the process of elaborating an institutional strengthening initiative in the area of \nrisk reduction focusing on the Ni\u00f1o phenomena, which will increase awareness among the communities. \n \nIn addition, the DIPECHO - Finnish Red Cross \u2013 International Federation Risk Reduction Project in the region \nof Chaco has been crucial to increase the visibility and credibility of the Paraguayan Red Cross within the \ninvolved communities, especially since the communities were provided with food items.  \n \nHow we work \nAll International Federation assistance seeks to adhere to the Code of Conduct for the \nInternational Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and Non-Governmental Organizations \n(NGO's) in Disaster Relief and is committed to the Humanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards \nin Disaster Response (Sphere) in delivering assistance to the most vulnerable. \n \nThe International Federation\u2019s activities are \naligned with its Global Agenda, which sets \nout four broad goals to meet the Federation's \nmission to \"improve the lives of vulnerable \npeople by mobilizing the power of humanity\". \nGlobal Agenda Goals: \n\u2022 Reduce the numbers of deaths, injuries and impact \nfrom disasters. \n\u2022 Reduce the number of deaths, illnesses and impact \nfrom diseases and public health emergencies. \n\u2022 Increase local community, civil society and Red Cross \nRed Crescent capacity to address the most urgent \nsituations of vulnerability. \n\u2022 Reduce \nintolerance, \ndiscrimination \nand \nsocial \nexclusion and promote respect for diversity and human \ndignity. \nContact information  \nFor further information specifically related to this operation please contact:  \n\u2022 \nIn \nParaguay: \nTeresa \nGamarra, \nParaguayan \nRed \nCross \nProject \nCoordinator; \nemail: \ntgamarra@highway.com.py; phone: (595) 98 239 1737 \n\u2022 \nIn Panama: Ariel Kestens, Head of the Pan American Disaster Response Unit, email: \nariel.kestens@ifrc.org; phone: (507) 316 1001; fax: (507) 316 1082. \n\u2022 \nIn Panama: Jean Pierre Taschereau, Disaster Management Delegate, PADRU; email: \njp.taschereau@ifrc.org; phone: (507) 316 1001; fax: (507) 316 1082  \n\u2022 \nIn Buenos Aires: Gustavo Ramirez, Regional Representation for the Southern Cone; email: \ngustavo.ramirez@ifrc.org;  \n\u2022 \nIn \nPanama: \nMaria \nAlc\u00e1zar, \nResource \nMobilization \nCoordinator, \nAmericas; \nemail: \nmaria.alcazar@ifrc.org; phone: (507) 380 0250; fax: (507) 317 1304.  \n\u2022 \nIn Geneva: Pablo Medina, Operations Coordinator for the Americas; email: pablo.medina@ifrc.org ; \nphone (41) 79 217 3376; fax: (41) 22 730 0395. \n \n<Final financial report below; click here to return to the title page> \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSelected Parameters\nReporting Timeframe\n2008/09-2009/03\nBudget Timeframe\n2008/09-2008/12\nAppeal\nMDRPY005\nBudget\nAPPEAL\nAll figures are in Swiss Francs (CHF)\nFinal Financial Report\nMDRPY005 - Paraguay - Drought\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies\nI.

The DREF is a vital part of the International \nFederation\u2019s disaster response system and increases the ability of national societies to respond to \ndisasters.  \nCHF 35,760 (USD 35,760 or EUR 22,719) has been \nallocated \nfrom \nthe \nFederation\u2019s \nDisaster \nRelief \nEmergency Fund (DREF) to support the Djibouti Red \nCrescent, Ethiopia Red Cross, and Kenya Red Cross \nsocieties in assessing the extent and severity of \nongoing drought conditions, its impact, and the ability \nof affected households to meet their essential food \nrequirements, without damaging their livelihoods, \nhealth and dignity. Unearmarked funds to repay DREF \nare encouraged. \n \nSummary: Drought conditions in several areas of the \nGreater Horn of Africa, including Djibouti, southern-eastern \nEthiopia, and northern-eastern Kenya, are likely to prolong, \nfurther exacerbating severe water and pasture shortages \nand food insecurity. In combination with rising food prices, \ndisplacement, market disruptions, civil insecurity and \nconflict, there is a certain risk of a food crisis and \nhumanitarian emergency for the second time in a little over \ntwo years. This operation aims at providing a demonstrated \nunderstanding of how people and communities currently \naffected by drought normally access food, the impact of the \ndrought on their current and future food security, and hence the most appropriate response in areas \nwhere they are facing or at risk of facing high to extreme food insecurity. \n \nThis operation is expected to be implemented over one month, and will therefore be completed by 23 \nMay, 2008. A Final Report will be made available three months after the end of the operation (by 23 \nAugust, 2008).  \n \n<Click here for contact details> \n \n \nThe situation \nAccording to the latest Famine Early Warning System (FEWS NET) Food Security Update for East Africa, \nthe combined effects of a strong La Ni\u00f1a event and the cooling of the western Indian Ocean waters will result \nin below-normal March-May rains in the Greater Horn of Africa (GHA). Drought conditions in several areas, \nincluding Djibouti, southern-eastern Ethiopia and northern-eastern Kenya, are therefore likely to prolong, \nfurther exacerbating severe water and pasture shortages and food insecurity. In addition, high international \nfuel and cereal prices, the recent political crisis in Kenya, and the below-normal October to December 2007 \nMap showing countries affected by \ndrought. Source: FEWSNET, 2008 \n \nKEY \nRed/Maroon: Extremely Food Insecure  \nBrown: Highly Food Insecure  \nYellow: Moderately Food Insecure  \nGreen: Generally Food Secure  \n \n2\nrains in northern Tanzania, which resulted in lower crop output, is likely to result in reduced access to food \nimports by the affected countries to be able to cope with food shortages. In combination with rising food \nprices, displacement, market disruptions, civil insecurity and conflict, there is a certain risk of another food \ncrisis and humanitarian emergency for the second time in a little over two years.  \n \nFollowing two previous poor rainy seasons, and a more severe than normal dry season in Djibouti, southern \nand eastern parts of Ethiopia, and northern and eastern Kenya, pastoral and agro-pastoral households \nrelying on livestock for access to income and food face high to extreme food insecurity. Another poor rainy \nseason would exacerbate food insecurity in these areas, where unusual livestock migrations are already \ntaking place and significant deterioration of livestock body conditions negatively impact both livestock \nproduction and their market value. A decline in livestock prices combined with an increase in staple food \nprices result in reduced pastoral terms of trade, household income and food access. Reduced harvests in \nrain-fed agro-pastoral and marginal crop-production areas would result in limited replenishment of household \nand market food stocks and further increase food prices. \n \nDelayed and below-normal rains in Djibouti are increasing food security concerns. Djibouti is very heavily \ndependent on imports of the main staple foods. Record-high staple food prices are severely restricting food \naccess, especially among the poorest urban and rural households. Terms of trade are not in favor of \npastoralists and poor urban households can hardly meet three-fourths of their daily minimum food \nrequirements. Increasing global prices of cereals and oil will further exacerbate this trend. \n \nIn Ethiopia, the south-eastern pastoral areas have suffered dry conditions as a result of poor rains in the last \ntwo seasons, leading to a short supply of water and pasture. Livestock body conditions, and therefore \nlivestock prices as well as production have notably worsened. Low cereal supply and high prices have \ndeteriorated the terms of trade of pastoral groups. Security related restrictions in Somali Region continue to \nlimit food access and worsen food insecurity, a situation aggravated by general inflation. Below-normal \nMarch to May rains would further limit national cereal supply and worsen drought conditions in the south-\neastern pastoral areas. Coupled with soaring international prices, this would significantly increase the \nnumber of people requiring humanitarian assistance. \n \nAccording to the government\u2019s Arid Lands and Resource Management Project (ALRMP) in Kenya, pastoral \nterms of trade have declined to more than 30 percent of the long-term mean. Poor livestock body conditions \nhave led to a reduction of between 5 and 10 percent in livestock prices in most pastoral areas during the \nJanuary to March dry season. The northwestern pastoral areas of Turkana have suffered the highest decline, \nup to 30 percent. Displacement as a result of the political crisis that erupted on December 2007 has led to \nlosses of 2007 crop harvests and reduced prepared land for the 2008 main cropping season. This will likely \nresult in reduced overall food availability, both locally and nationally. According to the inter-agency Kenya \nShort Rains Assessment Report 2008, the combined effect of increased price of staple food commodities, \nsupply shortages as a consequence of reduced national production, high international cereal prices, and a \npossible drought situation in some areas in 2008, poses a serious risk of a food security crisis in Kenya in \n2008 and the first half of 2009. \n \nCoordination and partnerships \nCoordination of Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement actors takes place through monthly meetings and \nregular information sharing and communications at the regional and country levels. Regional coordination \nwith other key operational agencies and organizations happens through the Food Security and Nutrition \nWorking Group. Country-specific coordination mechanisms include the Kenya Food Security Steering Group \n(KFSSG) in Kenya, and the Early Warning Working Group (EWWG) in Ethiopia. Coordination with \ngovernment authorities is ensured through the Djibouti Red Crescent, Ethiopia Red Cross and Kenya Red \nCross societies. \n \nRed Cross and Red Crescent action \nThe Kenya Red Cross Society has supported community water trucking activities. The International \nFederation has coordinated with the Djibouti Red Crescent, the Ethiopia Red Cross and the Kenya Red \nCross societies to organize an assessment in affected areas which would constitute the basis of a Plan of \nAction in anticipation of a possible emergency appeal, subject to assessment recommendations. In the case \nof Kenya, further discussion is ongoing with regards to the timing and suitability of the assessment. The \nInternational Federation has also launched a five year, 15 country African food security strategy, which \nincludes Kenya and Ethiopia, seeking to address some of the long-term underlying factors contributing to \nfood insecurity. \n \n3\nThe needs \nIn view of the initial information available, it is necessary to complement existing assessments through \ncountry-specific field assessments in order to determine the extent and severity of the drought, its impact, \nand the ability of affected households to meet their essential food requirements, without damaging their \nlivelihoods, health and dignity. These will constitute the basis for a Plan of Action to address needs that may \nrange from food assistance, to support primary food production, income-generation or employment, access \nto markets and/or asset development, protection or early recovery. \n \nThe proposed operation \n \nFood Security: Assessment and Analysis \n \nObjective: To base programme decisions in areas where people are facing or at risk of facing high to \nextreme food insecurity on a demonstrated understanding of how they normally access food, the \nimpact of the drought on current and future food security, and hence the most appropriate response. \n \nActivities planned  \n\u2022 \nPreparation of a food security assessment, including formulation of objectives, selection of \nassessment team, drafting terms of reference, budgeting and preparation of field visits. \n\u2022 \nCollection of secondary information. \n\u2022 \nCollection of primary information. \n\u2022 \nAnalysis. \n\u2022 \nReporting. \n\u2022 \nDesigning and drafting a Plan of Action. \n \nHow we work \nAll International Federation assistance seeks to adhere to the Code of Conduct for the \nInternational Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and Non-Governmental Organizations \n(NGO's) in Disaster Relief and is committed to the Humanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards \nin Disaster Response (Sphere) in delivering assistance to the most vulnerable. \nThe International Federation\u2019s activities \nare aligned with its Global Agenda, \nwhich sets out four broad goals to meet \nthe Federation's mission to \"improve \nthe lives of vulnerable people by \nmobilizing the power of humanity\". \nGlobal Agenda Goals: \n\u2022 Reduce the numbers of deaths, injuries and impact from \ndisasters. \n\u2022 Reduce the number of deaths, illnesses and impact from \ndiseases and public health emergencies. \n\u2022 Increase local community, civil society and Red Cross Red \nCrescent capacity to address the most urgent situations of \nvulnerability. \n\u2022 Reduce intolerance, discrimination and social exclusion and \npromote respect for diversity and human dignity. \nContact information  \nFor further information specifically related to this operation please contact:  \n\u2022 \nIn Ethiopia: Fasika Kabede, Secretary General, Ethiopian Red Cross Society, Addis Ababa; email: \nercs.sg@ethionet.et; Telephone: +251.11.515.38.53; Fax: +251.11.551.26.43 \n\u2022 \nIn Kenya: Abbas Gullet, Secretary General, Kenya Red Cross Society, Nairobi; email: \ngullet.abbas@kenyaredcross.org; Telephone: + 254.20.30.35.93; Fax: + 254.20.60.35.89 \n\u2022 \nIn Djibouti: Abdi Kaireh Bouh, Secretary General, Red Crescent of Djibouti, Djibouti Ville; email \ncrd@intnet.dj; Telephone: +253 352 270; Fax: +253 352451 \n\u2022 \nIn Kenya: Asha Mohammed, Head of Eastern Africa Zone, International Federation, Nairobi, email: \nasha.mohammed@ifrc.org; Telephone: +254.20.283.51.24, Fax: +254.20.271.27.77 \n\u2022 \nIn Geneva: John Roche, Operations Coordinator for Eastern and Southern Africa regions; email: \njohn.roche@ifrc.org; Telephone: +41.22.730.4400; Fax: +41 22 730 0395 \n \n<Click here to return to the title page> \n"

The Kenya Food Security Meeting (KFSM) report of 8 February 2006 noted that 396,525 \nmetric tonnes (MT) of additional food assistance, valued at USD 221,536,211, was required for 12 months.  \n \nOperational developments \nThe rains intensified across most areas of the country during the first week of May. According to the Kenya \nMeteorological Department, many parts of the severely drought-affected northern and eastern pastoral districts \nreceived good rains in April and early May. However, distribution of rainfall in some northern and eastern pastoral \nareas has been unsatisfactory, and additional rainfall is needed.  \n \nAccording to the Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWS NET), high intensity rainfall flooded localized \nareas of the coastal region, along the Lake Victoria shores and in some pastoral districts. The Kenya Red Cross \nSociety (KRCS) indicated that eight people were killed and an estimated 17,000 others were displaced by the floods \nin Malindi, Kilifi, Kwale, Nyando, Homa Bay, Migori, Siaya, Rachuonyo, Isiolo, Samburu, Laikipia and Wajir \ndistricts (For the Information Bulletin, refer to http://www.ifrc.org/docs/appeals/rpts06/ke0604013.pdf). In addition, \n650 hectares of crop were destroyed in Migori, Siaya and Rachuonyo districts. The significant proportion of the \nflood-affected population, outside the lakeshore, constitutes households that were also drought-affected and are \ncovered by World Food Programme\u2019s Emergency Operation (EMOP).  \n \nWhile food security is not expected to improve immediately, prospects for the recovery process have been enhanced \nby a favourable season. However, drought-affected pastoral households face a difficult recovery that is complicated \nby substantial decimation of herds during the 2005-06 drought. The Kenya Food Security Steering Group (KFSSG) \nrecognizes that despite the good rains, recovery efforts will not be as smooth as production in marginal areas (both \n \nKenya: Drought; Appeal no. MDRKE001; Operations Update no. 3 (Appeal Revision) \n \n \n \n3 \nagricultural and pastoral) will not pick up in the short run. It is generally accepted that pastoral communities have \nlost their resilience after about a succession of three to six poor seasons. A good recovery will require a series of \ngood seasons combined with longer-term initiatives to support the restoration of resilient livelihoods and sustained \nemergency interventions to mitigate high levels of acute food insecurity and malnutrition which has been endemic \nfor some time. \n \nComprehensive nutrition assessments coordinated by the Ministry of Health (MoH) and the United Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and carried out collaboratively with Action Against Hunger and M\u00e9decins Sans \nFronti\u00e8res (MSF) Belgium, suggest an alarming nutrition situation, with global acute malnutrition rates significantly \nhigher than the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) emergency threshold in Mandera, Marsabit, Moyale and \nSamburu districts (see Figure 3 below1).  Moreover, high rates of stunting (for example 23.5 per cent in Samburu \nand 21.7 per cent in Marsabit) indicate an extended period of malnutrition. UNICEF has reported that the wasting, \nstunting, mortality and health data collected in the surveys indicate a complex situation where malnutrition is caused \nby and contributes to the extremely poor health status of the population.   \n \n \n \nA nutritional survey carried out by MSF France in Marsabit indicated that the malnutrition rate of children aged \nunder five years is 30 per cent. Poor nutrition has now been made worse by measles outbreak in pastoral areas. The \nKRCS has responded by spearheading a measles campaign countrywide which has been largely successful (refer to \nthe Information Bulletin on http://www.ifrc.org/docs/appeals/rpts06/ke0604030.pdf).  \n \nConflicts are further exacerbating the already fluid drought conditions. Cattle raids between the Pokot and Samburu \ncommunities have displaced 20,000 pastoralists. Similar clashes between Gabbra and Boran communities in \nsouthern Ethiopia have had a spill-over on the Kenyan side near Dukana in Marsabit (refer to the Information \nBulletin on http://www.ifrc.org/docs/appeals/rpts06/ke0604030b.pdf). The pastoralists inhabit both sides of the \nporous Kenya-Ethiopia border and their displacement is causing severe stress among the already weakened \ncommunities.  \n \nDonations from the Kenyan public \nThe NS, through its volunteers, has distributed 1,223 MT of Unimix in Mandera, Marsabit, Isiolo, Turkana, \nMakueni, Kitui, Mwingi, Ijara, Kajiado, Wajir, Mbeere and Garissa districts. In total, 2,173 MT of food donations \nhave been distributed to 22 drought-stricken districts. Details on the number of beneficiaries reached and the impact \nmade will be provided in subsequent updates. \n                                                \n1 For more information, refer to FEWS NET\u2019s Kenya Center on: http://www.fews.net/centers/?f=ke  \n \nKenya: Drought; Appeal no.

The \nKRCS has earmarked CHF 1,009,944 received from the various companies for drilling, construction and desilting \nof earth dams, construction and rehabilitation of boreholes as well as training of water management committees. \nThe following districts are targeted for project implementation using the above funds: Turkana, Kilifi, Makueni, \nMwingi, Marsabit, Moyale, Samburu, Garissa, Wajir, Ijara, Kajiado, Nyeri and Isiolo.   \n \nBilateral funding \nThe NS is also in the process of rehabilitating 19 boreholes, constructing six pipeline extensions and desilting three \nearth dams under a European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) WatSan drought intervention programme, \nfacilitated through the Danish Red Cross. This will be implemented in Turkana, Marsabit, Isiolo, Kitui, Makueni \nand Kwale districts. Other activities to be implemented under this programme include equipping of 12 shallow \nwells, hygiene promotion, training of water management committees, supply of fuel subsidy and fast moving spares \nfor strategic boreholes (10 in each district) and distribution of a total of 60 storage tanks (10 in each district). \n \nThe KRCS will also receive funding from partner national societies (PNSs), including CHF 393,673 from the \nAmerican Red Cross for WatSan activities in Kwale, Kilifi and Lamu districts. The American Red Cross is also \nconsidering a concept paper for WatSan activities in Marsabit and Moyale districts estimated at CHF 1,816,950 for \nfunding. This will involve construction of earth dams/pans, drilling and equipping of boreholes, hygiene and water \nmanagement committees training. CHF 233,850 from the French Red Cross has been earmarked for boreholes and \nextension of pipelines for Bamba and Ganze divisions in Kilifi District, training of four water management \ncommittees and conducting 25 participatory hygiene and sanitation transformation (PHAST) training of trainers \n \nKenya: Drought; Appeal no.

The Federation has, upon request from the KRCS, made available additional \nhuman resources from the regional food security unit (FSU) to assist with the operation, including operational \nplanning and implementation. WatSan and food security delegates have assisted in this operation. Since the launch \nof the Appeal on behalf of the national society, two Operations Updates have been issued. Some funds from the \nFederation have been utilized in transporting food to the drought-affected districts. \n \nThe KRCS participated in a regional Drought Review Committee meeting, which was also attended by national \nsocieties of other drought-affected countries, from 25 to 27 April 2006 at the regional delegation in Nairobi. The \npurpose of the meeting was to review the regional food security plan of action (of the 19 January meeting) and the \nsubsequent Drafting Committee in early February. The following issues were addressed: review of the humanitarian \nsituation in 10 countries affected by the food security crisis; consideration of whether the Red Cross/Red Crescent \nactions taken to date were appropriate; effective and timely, capturing lessons learned, including Movement \ncooperation mechanisms; making recommendations for the medium-term monitoring and evaluation framework and \nconsidering the way forward for long-term food security. The Review Committee examined all the feedback from \nnational societies as well as other available information and set up a matrix describing the situation in each country. \n \nThe Kenya Drought Emergency Appeal has received positive response from various donors including partner \nnational societies (PNSs). Through the ECHO WatSan drought intervention programme facilitated by the Danish \nRed Cross, the KRCS will implement WatSan activities in Turkana, Marsabit, Isiolo, Kitui, Makueni and Kwale \ndistricts. Additional WatSan activities are planned in Kwale, Kilifi and Lamu districts through the support from the \nAmerican Red Cross and in Bamba and Ganze divisions, Kilifi District, through the support from the French Red \nCross. The Swedish Red Cross is interested in undertaking medium to longer-term WatSan activities in Mandera \nand Wajir districts whilst the Norwegian Red Cross has shown an interest in similar activities in the northern \ndistricts of Kenya. \n \nRed Cross and Red Crescent Movement - principles and initiatives  \nThe promotion of the Fundamental Principles of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement within \nthe target areas was addressed during the assessments and continued to be strengthened as the drought operation \nbecame fully operational.  \n \nCapacity of the national society \nThe KRCS headquarters, with the support of its volunteers and branch staff across the country, is in a position to \ncoordinate this operation, including the distribution of food and delivery of relief items to the drought-affected \n \nKenya: Drought; Appeal no. MDRKE001; Operations Update no. 3 (Appeal Revision) \n \n \n \n9 \npopulation. The national society has been involved in several similar operations in recent years, and as the leading \nhumanitarian agency in Kenya, coordinating the humanitarian response to floods and droughts in various parts of \nthe country. Through the current EMOP programme in Kwale and Marsabit, the KRCS participated in relief \ndistributions targeting 227,701 beneficiaries.  \n \nAdditional staff members have been recruited to strengthen the KRCS\u2019s support for these activities. Two water \nengineers have recently been seconded from the government to boost the WatSan capacity. In managing disasters \naffecting the country, the KRCS has very good relations with the government and also works closely with other \norganizations. The director of the KRCS disaster preparedness and response department will coordinate this \noperation, supported by other technical units. The KRCS has fully operational branches with both employed and \nvolunteer staff in all the affected districts. The branches will be instrumental in the distribution of relief items. \n \nCommunications \u2013 advocacy and public information \nThe KRCS issues one local press release each week inviting the media for public donations received at its \nheadquarters on Thursday afternoons. Other press releases are issued based on specific needs such as giving critical \ninformation about the drought operation or during the flagging-off of donations. The KRCS has also participated in \nvarious local media initiatives to publicize the drought, thereby increasing resources. The NS will continue to carry \nout advocacy activities. Contacts continue to be made with both the local and international media to conduct \ninterviews as well as to produce and publish articles and photographs so as to raise awareness to the public about \nthe plight of the drought-affected communities. Programmes will be designed and undertaken to encourage \nnewspapers, radio and television stations to publish solidarity articles appealing for public and corporate sector \nsupport to assist the population affected by drought. \n \n \nRevised budget and interim financial report below; click here to return to the title page. \nBUDGET \nPROGRAMME BUDGETS SUMMARY\nMDRKE001\nName:\nKENYA FROUGHT

It is the \nworld\u2019s largest humanitarian organization and its millions of volunteers are active in over 185 countries. \nIn Brief \nFinal Report; Period covered: 22 July 2005 to 23 July 2006; Final appeal coverage: 81.4%. \n \n<Click here for the final financial report>\n \nAppeal history: \n\u2022 \nEmergency Appeal launched on 22 July 2005 for CHF 18,243,483 (USD 14,211,607 or EUR 11,642,754) \nin cash, kind or services to assist 44,400 households (220,000 beneficiaries) \u2013 in Burkina Faso, Mali, \nMauritania and Niger \u2013 for six months.  \n\u2022 \nA Revised Plan of Action, issued on 7 August 2005, specified assistance to 76,571 households (532,000 \nbeneficiaries) over a six months period.  \n\u2022 \nOperation Update no. 1 was issued on 27 August 2005.  \n\u2022 \nOperation Update no. 2 was issued on 25 October 2005.  \n\u2022 \nOperation Update no. 3 was issued on 8 December 2005.  \n\u2022 \nOperation Update no. 4, issued on 9 February 2006, provided a six-month Supplementary Plan of \nAction and extended the appeal\u2019s timeframe until 23 July 2006. \n\u2022 \nOperation Update no. 5, dated 13 April 2006, increased the appeal budget to CHF 31,242,371 (USD \n24,051,094 or EUR 19,798,714). \n\u2022 \nOperation Update no. 6 was issued on 7 July 2006. \n\u2022 \nThis operation was reported at length and in detail in the Operation Updates hyperlinked above as \nwell as Operations Fact Sheets 1 to 4. For these as well as news stories, photos and press releases \nrelated to the Sahel food crisis visit: http://www.ifrc.org/what/disasters/response/sahel/index.asp  \n\u2022 \nDisaster Relief Emergency Funds (DREF) allocated CHF 280,000. Funds have been reimbursed. \n \nThis operation was aligned with the International Federation's Global Agenda, which sets out four broad \ngoals to meet the Federation's mission to \"improve the lives of vulnerable people by mobilizing the power of \nhumanity\". \n \nGlobal Agenda Goals: \n\u2022 \nReduce the numbers of deaths, injuries and impact from disasters. \n\u2022 \nReduce the number of deaths, illnesses and impact from diseases and public health emergencies. \n\u2022 \nIncrease local community, civil society and Red Cross/Red Crescent capacity to address the most \nurgent situations of vulnerability. \n\u2022 \nReduce intolerance, discrimination and social exclusion and promote respect for diversity and \nhuman dignity. \n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \n                                                \nBackground and summary \nIn 2004 and 2005, countries of the Sahel region experienced the worst locust invasion of 20 years coupled with low \nrainfalls and drought conditions. This situation resulted in a severe food crisis and heightened malnutrition in many \nlocations of Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger. Niger was, however, the most affected country.  \n \nAs part of its overall stewardship for West Africa, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent \nSocieties regional delegation in Dakar closely monitored the situation. Through several assessment and support \nmissions to the concerned countries, the delegation assisted National Societies in disseminating warnings of \nupcoming food insecurity to affected communities as well as governments, national and international organizations.  \n \nAs the food security situation became increasingly alarming, the \nregional delegation deployed a three-member team comprising one \nconsultant and two Regional Disaster Response Team (RDRT) \nmembers to carry out a detailed assessment of the food security \nsituation in Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali and Mauritania and to assist \nthe National Societies in identifying their role in addressing the issue \nconsidering \ntheir \nexperience \nand \noperational \ncapacities. \nIn \ncoordination with the UN Office for the Coordination of \nHumanitarian Affairs (OCHA), World Food Programme (WFP), the \nUN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), other organizations \nand governments, the team developed recommendations for the \nFederation on ways of providing support to National Societies in the \nregion and possible interventions. Based on the findings of the \nassessments and information collected through secondary sources, the \nmain justifications for an emergency intervention were as follows: \nVillagers in drought-hit Tigar, Niger, gather \nfor a Red Cross food distribution. A \ncombination of drought and a locust invasion \nleft many parts of the Sahel region \ndesperately \nshort \nof \nfood. \nMark \nSnelling/British Red Cross. \n\u2022 \nLoss of life: There was increasing evidence from M\u00e9decins Sans \nFronti\u00e8res (MSF) and other sources that children were dying \u2013 \nparticularly in Niger \u2013 as a result of the crisis in the Sahel region;    \n\u2022 \nFood and health loss: Agricultural production in Niger during 2004 was severely affected by the locust invasion \nand drought.  Estimates from an assessment mission by the government, WFP, Famine Early Warning System \nNetwork (FEWS NET) and the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control (CILSS1) in March 2005 \nconcluded that 2.5 million people \u2013 approximately 20 percent of Niger\u2019s population \u2013 were food insecure and \nrequired food assistance.  The loss in cereal production was approximately 15 per cent compared to the average \nannual production over the last five years, or a grain deficit of about 225,000 metric tonnes (MT) for the year \n2005. While Mali, Burkina Faso and Mauritania were not as severely affected, they were still part of the same \ndisaster situation and needed support to discourage a further deterioration of the situation;     \n\u2022 \nLivestock loss: Livestock \u2013 particularly cattle, horses and donkeys that were least resistant to drought \u2013 were \nseverely affected by fodder shortages. Many dead carcasses were visible throughout the hardest hit parts of \nNiger and Mali.  Dakoro, Filingu\u00e9 and Ouallam were among the worst affected zones.  While no epidemics \nwere reported  (only food deficiencies and parasites) it was noted that coping capacities appeared to be stretched \nto the limit by continuing high cereal prices that translated into poor terms of trade in the selling livestock to \nbuy cereals; \n\u2022 \nEmployment loss: Because of food insecurity, many people were migrating in increasing numbers to larger \npopulation centres in search of employment or means to gain money. Population movement was considered a \nnegative indicator as it could have a detrimental impact on families, communities and security. \n \nOn 22 July 2005, the International Federation launched an Emergency Appeal seeking CHF 18,243,483 to assist \n44,400 households over a period of six months. While the Federation Emergency Appeal put forth immediate \nresponse efforts, those longer-term in nature were left for further definition pending programme support, general \nactivity progress and evolution of the crisis at hand.  After initial emergency response efforts and with the structural \nnature of the crisis in Niger and other affected countries becoming clearer, it became apparent that the initial six-\nmonth timeframe incorporating emergency, post-crisis and developmental activities was too tight. By mid-January \n2006, activities undertaken as part of the emergency appeal had reached 644,525 people (beyond the revised target \n \n1 In French: Comit\u00e9 Inter-Etate pour la Lutte contre la S\u00e9cheresse au Sahel \n \n \n2\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nof 536,000 beneficiaries), mainly due to a high response to supplementary feeding for malnourished children and \ntheir families. The appeal was subsequently revised; the number of targeted people was increased to 76,571 families \n(536,000 beneficiaries) and the timeframe was extended until end of July 2006. In line with these changes, the \nAppeal budget was increased to CHF 31,242,371 (USD 24,051,094 or EUR 19,798,714) on 13 April 2006.  \n \nAmong the various programmes of the Sahel operation, principal beneficiaries included moderately malnourished \nchildren and their families, households suffering from severe food shortages, the elderly, the ill, orphans and \ndisadvantaged pastoralist communities. Through the Red Cross/Red Crescent intervention, the assisted populations \nbenefited from sensitization and education campaigns as well as community projects such as food-for-work, \nbuilding and repair of wells, health, nutrition and hygiene training, skill enhancement and professional \ndevelopment. \n \nThis operation was effectively planned and managed, and achieved clear impact. Based on the initial success in \ndelivering the intended assistance, initiatives were undertaken to implement plans previously outlined in the appeal, \nwith a reasonable expectation that donors would support the activities and meet their obligations accordingly. \nUnfortunately, the anticipated funding support did not materialize, but the Federation had already engaged and \ncommitted with the National Societies and other partners. As a result, the operation was faced with a considerable \ndeficit (see attached final financial report). While this may raise valid questions over financial management and \ndiscipline, the Federation will resolve the situation transparently, working with the concerned National Societies. \nFor further questions related to this issue, please refer to the list of <contact details> provided at the end of this \nreport. \n \nAnalysis of the operation - objectives, achievements and impact \n \nGoal: Provide support to the affected Red Cross and Red Crescent national societies in order to decrease and \nfurther prevent vulnerability to food insecurity and malnutrition by immediately responding in the form of \nlivelihood interventions for 76,571 households (536,000 beneficiaries) over a six-month period. [As per the \nRevised Plan of Action of 7 August 2005]. \n \nSpecific objective 1 (Relief - general food distributions): Distribute a monthly general food ration to 76,571 \nhouseholds (536,000 people) in Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger.   \n \nAchievements \n \nBurkina Faso: Food distributions in the Northern provinces of Burkina Faso were completed by the end of April \n2006. However, following a field visit undertaken by the Federation, Burkinabe Red Cross Society and the \nLuxembourg Red Cross in Yatenga, Loroum and Soum provinces in December 2005, it was found that the northern \nregions still experienced severe effects of the drought as well as \nattacks by caterpillars and seed-eating birds. In some areas, food \nstocks could potentially last only two months since some producers \nwere already eating their new crop while they harvested. The \nassessment mission concluded that distributions needed to be \ncontinued in these areas, especially Oudalan, Soum, Yatenga, Loroum, \nSoum and Oudalan provinces.  \n \nConsequently, a supplementary round of distributions was done in \nSoum, Oudalan and Yatenga, reaching 19 sites and 8,984 households \nwith approximately 998 metric tonnes (MT) of foodstuffs. Rations \ncomprised of the following: 70 kg of millet, 20 kg of rice, 15 kg of \nniebe and 6 litres of vegetable oil per household in Oudalan Province; \n60 kg of millet or sorghum, 30 kg of rice, 15 kg of niebe and 6 litres of \nvegetable oil in Soum and Yatenga provinces.  \n \nMali: Mali Red Cross distributed commodities provided by the World \nFood Programme (WFP). In total, 41,413 children, aged between 5 \nand 59 months, benefited from 1.491 MT of food.  \nThe Niger Red Cross distributes essential \nfood aid to villagers in Tigar. According to \nUN statistics, some 3.6 million of Niger\u2019s 12 \nmillion inhabitants were directly affected by \nthe food crisis. Mark Snelling/British Red \nCross. \n \n \n3\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nMali Red Cross, supported directly by the Federation, provided an additional 329 MT of food. Four distribution \nrounds were planned over 120 days and took place at 104 sites among 14 communes in Timbuktu, Goundam and \nGourma-Rharous. They targeted 10,226 children, of whom 4,036 were female. Rations were composed of 250 \ngrammes of enriched flour (CSB), 30 grammes of oil and 20 grammes of sugar per child per day.  \n \nNiger: The Federation completed its two rounds of general food distribution in Tillab\u00e9ri and Agadez provinces by \nmid-October 2005, in line with the onset of the year\u2019s harvest. An estimated 143,558 beneficiaries were reached and \nover 3.327 MT of foodstuffs distributed. \n \nGiven the immense distances involved both within and between distribution areas, two logistical hubs were \nestablished for each distribution centre \u2013 one in Filingu\u00e9 and one in Agadez. A dedicated group of Red Cross \nSociety of Niger volunteers were recruited and trained for the operation (130 in Tillab\u00e9ri and 50 in Agadez). The \nRed Cross teams worked in close cooperation with village heads and local leaders in identifying and confirming \nbeneficiaries.  \n \nImpact \nThe nutritional status of vulnerable families was markedly increased. It was estimated that calorie intake had been \nraised from 90 calories per person to 1,777 calories per person, which was within the accepted norm of 2,100 \ncalories per person. \n \nConstraints \nTargeting and initial estimates of numbers of beneficiaries for general food distributions were based on government \ncensus figures. As a result, beneficiary numbers were generally underestimated and members of semi-nomadic \ncommunities were not always included. Furthermore, relief teams identified a number of \u2018gap villages\u2019 with \nequivalent needs that had not been included in lists initially received. A degree of \u2018on-the-spot diplomacy\u2019 and \nflexibility ended up being demonstrated by Federation relief teams in allocating rations and adjusting second round \ndistributions in order to meet the needs of additional people vulnerable throughout a number of communities. \n \nThe distances and remote nature of many villages created logistical challenges and an increased workload for relief \ndistributions \u2013 in one case mules were used as a local means of transportation for general food distributions.  In \nBurkina Faso, the greatest constraints were distances between the capital, Ouagadougou, and main areas of \noperation, posing a challenge in purchasing, transport and general programme implementation. Distributions in \nareas such as Soum were complicated by the existence of large areas of swampy land following the rainy season, \nmaking access highly difficult. To counter the problem, distribution points were established in the nearest dry areas. \nAlthough new distribution points posed greater travelling distances for beneficiaries, they remained accessible by \ncart enabling the local population to still receive much needed food assistance in a fairly timely manner.   \n \nIn Mali, transport was challenging as some villages were not reachable by road; \u2018pinasses\u2019 or motorized pirogues \nwere, therefore, rented. Unfortunately, pinasses could not ensure totally secure transportation since some goods \ncould become wet and unusable and others could be lost overboard. Furthermore, the duration of distributions in \nMali was prolonged due to difficulties in the identification of children as many bear similar names.  In addition, due \nto migration habits, organizing distributions for nomadic populations was generally a challenge.  \n \nSpecific objective 2: (Health \u2013 supplementary feeding): Provide basic health services through emergency \nsupplementary feeding for targeted vulnerable children aged under five years, to a total population of 24,500 \nin Niger. \n \nAchievements \nRed Cross/Red Crescent supplementary feeding programmes were operational in Niger since 1 August 2005 in \ncooperation with the French Red Cross (who already had an established bilateral programme in Niger), the Qatari \nRed Crescent and the Spanish Red Cross in the regions of Tahoua, Maradi, Zinder, Tanout and Agadez. By the \nclose of September 2005, the government of Niger had a new protocol in place, establishing its responsibility for the \nnutritional situation in the country. By that time, the Federation was questioning the merits of a \u2018parallel system\u2019 of \na supplementary feeding being conducted by the international humanitarian community as a long-term venture. It \nbecame clear that the Federation, in partnership with the Red Cross Society of Niger needed to assist government \nregional authorities in making their health centre personnel more tangibly responsible for the management of \nmalnutrition. \n \n \n4\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nBy mid-January 2006, 48,525 moderately malnourished children had been treated through the Red Cross/Red \nCrescent supplementary feeding centres at Tahoua, Maradi, Zinder, Agadez-Arlit and Tanout. An additional 3,825 \nmoderately malnourished children were treated between February and September 2006. In addition to the treatment \nrations for malnourished children (UNIMIX), their families received protection rations, bringing the total number of \nbeneficiaries to 291,150. The protection rations were composed of 100 kg of cereals, 50 kg of beans and four litres \nof vegetable oil per month. This ration was halved after the harvest (end of October 2005), and was discontinued \ncompletely in December 2005.   \n \nConstraints  \nThe caseload of supplementary feeding centres was higher than \nexpected, putting additional strain and workload on Red Cross \nvolunteers \nand \ndelegates. \nThe \noverwhelming \nresponse \nto \nsupplementary feeding and the provision of family protection rations \n\u2013 the combination of a health programme and relief activity \u2013 posed \nchallenges for ensuring quality programming, adequate training and \nservice provision, general staff supervision and management.  \nNiger Red Cross Society volunteers weighing \na little child. According to the Niger Red \nCross, many children were moderately or \nseverely \nmalnourished \nin \nNiger. \nOlav \nSaltbones/Norwegian Red Cross. \n \nAnother main challenge for the supplementary feeding treatment \nprogramme was the prevalence of malaria and other endemic diseases \nin Niger. As a result, the health programme of the Qatari Red \nCrescent involved additional training and treatment for malaria as \npart of its supplementary feeding activities. Vaccination programmes \nwere also implemented at a number of the feeding centres. \n \nThe protection ratios that were being provided to families with \nmalnourished children were ultimately discontinued due to the \nfollowing reasons:  \n\u2022 \nAnecdotal evidence indicated that children were been kept \ndeliberately malnourished so that their families could receive \nthe rations;  \n\u2022 \nObservations by staff and volunteers showed that some \nmothers took their children to the health centres only when \nthere were distributions of family rations;  \n\u2022 \nSome women gave their children purgative plants to keep \nthem thin, thus eligible for the programme. \n \nSpecific objective 3 (relief \u2013 cash distribution): As per the Revised Plan of Action of 7 August 2005, a cash \ndistribution was foreseen targeting 20,000 beneficiaries, or 4,000 households, to communities in Niger and \nMali. \n \nAchievements \nAs of 18 November 2005, cash distributions were completed at Tanout assisting 34,278 beneficiaries (5,713 \nhouseholds) in 88 villages and three pastoralist settlements. One-time cash grants of XOF 120,000 (approximately \nUSD 240 or EUR 182), were provided to each household.  \n \nAs part of the cash project \u2013 and through a unique partnership between the Federation, British Red Cross, Swedish \nRed Cross and University of Arizona \u2013 a monitoring regime began in the aftermath of the distributions to assess \ntheir impact at household, village, market and regional levels. Quantitative and qualitative information gathering \nalso focused on the impact of cash distributions on the nutritional status of recipient and non-recipient households. \nThe report of the evaluation is available upon request.  \n \nIn summary (according to the Phase III evaluation report), households that received financial support from the Red \nCross/Red Crescent were less likely to be indebted (4.9 per cent compared to 25.3 per cent). Among indebted \nhouseholds, cash recipients were lesser in debt compared to those who did not receive cash (average amount to be \nrepaid XOF 24,514 for cash villages and XOF 64,625 for control villages). These findings support reports from \n \n \n5\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nPhase I and II evaluations, which indicated that households used financial resources from the Red Cross cash \ndistribution to pay off loans and reduce indebtedness. The reports are available upon request. \n \nImpact \nAssistance was provided to 5,713 vulnerable families at a critical juncture in the yearly cycle, by providing them \nwith the means to manage their immediate economic needs and reestablish their households on a more secure \nfinancial footing.  \n \nConstraints \nOpposition to cash distribution by some non-governmental and international organizations, coupled with unclear \nsupport from the authorities, led to a degree of confusion that came close to derailing the project. A last-minute \nmessage received from the Governor of Zinder, conveyed through the Head of the CCA (who is responsible to the \nCabinet and Office of the Prime Minister), temporarily suspended cash distributions just prior to the scheduled start \nof the project. Following extensive negotiations, a formal agreement with the government was reached, sanctioned \nby the President of Niger, with full support from the Red Cross Society of Niger. \n \nLack of banking facilities in Tanout and surrounding remote villages led to some logistical and security challenges. \nHowever, these were successfully addressed and the project progressed well. \n \nSpecific objective 4 (Logistics, administration and telecoms): Immediately augment the existing Red Cross \nand Red Crescent National Societies with logistical, administrative and telecommunications infrastructure in \nthe four different countries of the Sahel operation. \n \nAchievements \n \nIT/Telecoms: The Mali Red Cross benefited from the presence of an IT/Telecoms delegate during the first six \nmonths of the Sahel operation when the main installations were done. The Sahel operation IT/Telecoms team \ninstalled a wide area network/local area network (WAN/LAN) with an access point and Internet connection for \napproximately 15 users. A counterpart from the National Society was recruited and trained; before leaving Mali, the \nSahel operation IT/Telecom team handed over to the IT/telecom counterpart who would ensure proper maintenance \nof the equipment, with support from the team in Niamey. A total of five laptops and three radios were provided by \nthe British Red Cross and two new desktops, one network printer and radios by the Federation.  \n \nIn Mauritania, the Federation installed three high frequency (HF) and very high frequency (VHF) bases in Zoucrete, \nNouakchott and Nema/Nouadibhou, and two mobile HF and VHF units (with 15 handsets), in response to \npopulation movements.   \n \nIn Burkina Faso, the British Red Cross provided the Burkinabe Faso \nRed Cross Society with four laptops, two Thuraya satellite phones as \nwell as HF and VHF equipment in two vehicles.  \n \nIn addition to IT/telecom bases that already existed in Niger, the \nFederation provided the Red Cross Society of Niger with one laptop, \ntwo desktops, one network printer, two HF and VHF bases for Niamey \nand Tahoua as well as two HF and VHF mobiles and 15 handsets. An \nIT/telecom counterpart was recruited and trained, and an Internet \nconnection was provided. \n \nLogistics: Overall, logistics of the operation functioned well, despite \nsome under-staffing and staff change challenges. The fleet in Niger \nran at full capacity, with 31 Federation vehicles and 11 rental vehicles \ncovering over 200,000 km a month, often over difficult terrain. The \noperation in Mali was also a logistical success, as commodities were delivered to a much dispersed set of \nbeneficiaries, also over very challenging terrains.   \nInternational Federation officials preparing \nTSU trucks for food distributions in Niger. \nOlav Saltbones/Norwegian Red Cross. \n \n \n \n6\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \n                                                \nFor the distributions that were undertaken in Burkina Faso, 333.5 MT of rice, sorghum and oil were transported \nfrom the Red Cross Society of Niger/Federation/Transport Support Unit (TSU) warehouse in Niamey to the various \ndistribution sites. Two Federation logisticians were dispatched from Niger to support the relief delegate and the \nBurkinabe Red Cross Society to complete the distributions and to assess the National Society\u2019s capacities.  \n \nIn Filingue-Abala (Niger), as part of food-for-work activities, a sub-office and warehouse were temporarily \nestablished at Abala.  Ten Transport Support Unit trucks were dispatched as part of the food-for-work effort, and a \nstock of 200 MT of cereals was put in place. TSU operational hubs were based in Tahoua and Maradi, with \napproximately 20 trucks in each location and 30 trucks remaining in Niamey.  \n \nLogistics training in Niamey was completed, with similar training (for about 10 people per session for 3 days) \nundertaken in Zinder, Agadez, Tillabery, Tahoua and Maradi. The warehouse and compound of the Red Cross \nSociety of Niger were also renovated to include a new entry zone, an improved grading to protect the area against \nground water and rains as well as new roofing. \n \nApart from supporting the Federation and other Red Cross/Red Crescent activities, the TSU supported WFP \ncooperating partners such as Action Against Hunger (ACF 2), Concern and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) \nthrough \u2018cluster deployments\u2019 of up to ten trucks.  \n \nImpact \nThe logistics team supported Federation operations and Partner National Society programmes, concentrating its \nactivities on the general food distributions and supplementary feeding programmes. Though the enormous distances \nthat had to be covered (compounded by an often unreliable supply chain) posed some challenges, beneficiary needs \nwere met in a timely and regular manner. \n \nConstraints \nIn Burkina Faso, internal and external communications were hampered by a lack of equipment, difficult and \nunreliable connections and a lack of available technical personnel to pursue implementation of IT/telecoms activities. \n \nThe long distances involved in transporting goods across the region, the quality of the transport infrastructure and \nweather conditions at certain times, compounded by an unreliable supply chain, posed challenges for operational \nlogistics. Despite the constraints, the Federation possessed a dynamic logistics team able to overcome obstacles so \nthat beneficiary demands could be met in a timely and regular manner.   \n \nAmong logistical challenges, one difficulty was the imposition by the Government of Niger on limits of tonnage for \ntrucks passing through Niamey. Shipments for a number of organizations, most notably the Federation, WFP and \nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), were blocked in transit due to the new regulations which levied fines of \nXOF 10,000 per metric tonne on cargo exceeding 25 metric tonnes. In response, the Federation sought and received \na temporary exemption for its food commodities that were already en route. \n \nThe receipt of food commodities was a complicated process since limited information tended to be provided by \nfreight forwarders regarding expected delivery times. Discussions with freight forwarders on behalf of Sahel \nOperation staff improved the situation, resulting in the ultimate receipt of all goods.  \n \nSpecific objective 5 (Relief - livestock interventions for Mali and Niger): As per the Revised Plan of Action of \n7 August 2005, it was anticipated that 5,000 pastoralists would be assisted in Mali and Niger.   \n \nAchievements  \nThe food distributions also provided the opportunity to undertake parallel activities in the area of livestock health \nand support. On 11 November 2005, livestock vaccination sensitization campaigns started in different villages in the \nSalam Region, in cooperation with the Malian Ministry of Livestock. Radio stations broadcasted campaign \ninformation in four local languages and heads of villages were contacted as part of the sensitization process.   \n \n \n2 In French: Action Contre la Faim \n \n \n7\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \n                                                \nIn turn, 15,897 heads of livestock were vaccinated in Salam and Gourma Rharous. The number of cattle attended to \nwas well above the original target of 10,000, despite reticence amongst pastoralists in identifying exact numbers of \ncattle due to taxation implications.  \n \nIn December 2005 and January 2006, two rounds of fodder distributions were undertaken in the Salam Region. \nTheir purpose was to ensure livestock fodder consumption, prevent livestock sales on the markets and guarantee \nfodder in cold periods. There were two main breeder selection criteria; at least one malnourished child in the \nhousehold and breeders had to own between 10 and 50 livestock heads. Roughly 10,400 livestock heads benefited \nfrom fodder distributions totalling 180 MT. \n \nImpact \nReinforcing vulnerable livestock, thereby enabling on-going viability of pastoralist communities through a livestock \nvaccination programme and the distribution of fodder, enabled them to build up their livestock capacity so as to \nsurvive the extreme temperatures period that begins in December. \n \nSpecific objective 6 (Relief - cereal bank support for Mali and Niger): As per the Revised Plan of Action of 7 \nAugust 2005, it was anticipated that food stocks could be placed at cereal banks in 250 of the worst affected \ncommunities in Mali and Niger. \n \nAchievements \nAs monitoring progressed, it became evident that cereal banks could be a means of further assisting people affected \nby drought in Niger. Preliminary investigations suggested that as many as 50 villages could benefit from cereal \nbanks as a means of enhancing their longer-term food security.   \n \nA project manager from the British Red Cross arrived in Niger to develop a pilot cereal bank project, along with \nacademic staff from the University of Arizona. In addition to the funding provided by the British Red Cross, the \nFederation agreed to provide logistics support for the research and implementation phases of the pilot project.  \n \nVillage lands were identified, sites were confirmed using the Global Positioning System (GPS) and official \ndocuments were signed by village chiefs who authorized allocation of the land. A total of 21 cereal banks were \nconstructed in villages around Tanout; construction was completed in July, 2006, before the onset of the rainy \nseason. The banks were built using cement bricks, concrete and steel. The rationale for using these materials to \nbuild the cereal banks, instead of local traditional materials, was based on research done (reflecting on the use of \nboth types of products) with an important factor being the reduction of overhead costs, thus contributing to longer-\nterm sustainability. \n \nTwenty one village committees for cereal bank management were created and a three-day management training was \nconducted. Several items, including tables, chairs, notebooks, pens and cleaning products for the cereal banks, were \nprovided. Since the cereal banks began operating during the lean season, rice sales started immediately after \nconstruction was completed and management committees were in place.   \n \nAccording to the original design, households were required to pay a XOF 500 membership fee in order to purchase \ncereals3 from the banks. In Farak, 200 households were active in the cereal banks, with each household eligible to \npurchase up to five tias per week.  Funds collected from the sales were to be kept until after the harvest, when prices \ndropped significantly and more cereals could be purchased for use in the next lean season. \n \nConstraints \nDue to the requirement to pay membership fees, it was found out that 30 per cent of households were not accessing \nfood in the banks by July 2006. Management committees were primarily comprised of men, and it was not possible \nto ascertain whether the most vulnerable households were represented in the committees. Given that literacy and \nnumeracy skills were some of the criteria used to select members of the committee, it is likely that the most \nvulnerable households were not represented. In Farak, CARE had been working for two years, providing support to \n \n3 During a post-operation evaluation of the project, a meeting with women in Farak village revealed that they were paying XOF \n850 per tia of rice in the banks, compared to XOF 1,100 in the market.    \n \n \n8\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \n                                                \nwomen\u2019s village banks. The skills gained by the women in managing cereal banks could have been capitalized upon \nin setting up the management committee for the Red Cross-supported cereal banks. Women, who had proven their \nability to manage the savings of village banks and had gained the trust of their members, could have formed the \nmanagement committees. The Red Cross has realized this and in future, such interventions shall take into \nconsideration available skills and gender balance. \n \nSpecific objective 7 (Health \u2013 post-emergency health for Niger): Sustainable health interventions to promote \nresilience and improve the longer-term health of the most vulnerable are advocated.   \n \nAchievements \n \nMalnutrition strategy \nAs part of the technical support-transition process for the integrated health centres (CSI)4, and on behalf of the \nFederation and the Red Cross Society of Niger, 60 health officers and 30 general staff were trained in malnutrition \nscreening and treatment (according to the national protocol), and supplementary feeding stock management. The \ntraining and integration of services was undertaken in 15 health centres, including Hadachimo, Mogheur, Dangona, \nMaboya, Ill\u00e9la, Bagaroua, S\u00e9hia, T\u00e9baram, Toulou, Edir, Dandoutchi, Taja\u00e9, Dandaji and Moull\u00e9la. As part of the \nintegration strategy, the Federation trained 40 Red Cross Society of Niger volunteers who will continue providing \ntechnical support to community health centres.  \n \nBecause chronic malnutrition is a result of specific behaviours towards food and hygiene, the main focus of the \nSahel operation health team at Tahoua was educating key people (matrons within communities and Red Cross \nSociety of Niger volunteers) as agents who would sensitize and mobilize the local populations. To this end, 60 \nmatrons and 40 Red Cross Society of Niger volunteers working with the CSI in Tahoua and Ill\u00e9la districts were \ntrained in nutrition information, education and communication (IEC).  \n \nMatrons were considered key people as they are usually the traditional advisers of mothers on children\u2019s health \nissues within communities. Training sessions for matrons typically lasted two days while for volunteers took one \nday. A training of trainers (ToT) session for Red Cross Society of Niger counterparts in nutrition and education was \nalso undertaken through the health programme in Tahoua. In addition, 150 training sessions on nutrition followed in \nJuly 2006.  \n \nMobile health \nFollowing a pilot mobile health team project initiated in October 2005 in the Tahoua area, a Memorandum of \nUnderstanding was entered into with the regional health authorities for on-going delivery of much needed basic \nhealth care to remote communities that lacked access to basic health services.  \n \nIn November 2005, three mobile clinics were set up in Tahoua, with five trained volunteers in each. They visited 48 \ndifferent sites (120 villages in three different health districts), often together with the major (nurse) from the nearest \nhealth centre. During the visits, they vaccinated children aged under five years, made prenatal and post natal \nconsultations, sensitized women on basic health issues, conducted malnutrition screening, and provided de-worming \nmedication.  \n \nBetween March and August 2006, 9,888 children had been vaccinated and 1,906 de-wormed. The vaccination \ncoverage in the region where the clinics were operating was more than 90 per cent. 2,674 prenatal consultations \nwere held where women were vaccinated, and 3,731 malnourished children were identified and sent to malnutrition \ncentres. About 8,196 women were reached with messages/information on breastfeeding issues, weaning, diarrhoea, \nvaccination of new-borns, malaria, use of mosquito nets, food-environmental-and body hygiene, and family \nplanning. \n \nImpact \nThe mobile health teams contributed to the improvement of access to primary health in the Tahoua region. Due to \nimproved access, the vaccination coverage amongst children under 11 months was increased in the region and in \nother areas of operation under the supplementary feeding programmes. \n \n \n4 In French: Centre de Sant\u00e9 Int\u00e9gr\u00e9 (CSI) \n \n \n9\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nConstraint \nDistances to these remote villages were great, sometimes between 150 and 230 km, and road access was non-\nexistent.  \n \nSpecific objective 8: Water and sanitation (WatSan), Niger \n \nAchievements \nFollowing an assessment mission undertaken in September 2005, a number of potential water and sanitation \nactivities were outlined that were to be implemented immediately or over the mid-term and longer-term. Among the \nactivities were the following: construction and rehabilitation of well; construction and rehabilitation of school \nlatrines; and construction and rehabilitation of family latrines. With assistance from the Swedish Red Cross, \nimplementation of WatSan activities began. The programme was later scaled up with financial support from the \nQatari Red Crescent and it is being implemented after the close of the Sahel operation.  \n \nEighty volunteers from the Red Cross Society of Niger were trained in Participatory Hygiene and Sanitation \nTransformation (PHAST), a methodology that builds on people\u2019s innate ability to address and resolve their own \nproblems. In turn, the Red Cross volunteers trained community-based volunteers in the targeted villages; the Red \nCross volunteers were equipped with motorbikes to facilitate easy reach (five villages per volunteer). More than 70 \nof these volunteers conducted sensitization activities in 235 villages of Tahoua, Tillabery and Zinder. In Tahoua and \nin Filingu\u00e9, 110 water management committees have been formed and their members trained. The committees are \nnow responsible for managing the wells constructed/rehabilitated under the project. Similar committees will be \nestablished in Zinder. The WatSan activities will continue until end of July 2007. \n \nImpact \nHygiene promotion, using the PHAST methodology, in Tahoua contributed towards cholera prevention \u2013 in 2006 \u2013 \nin areas where cholera is endemic, such as in Bouza.   \n \nConstraints \nAt the beginning, implementation of activities was slow because there were no community-based volunteers in the \ntargeted villages. Due to delays in implementation, water and sanitation activities should continue for two years to \nassure the ownership of the infrastructure by the beneficiaries. \n \nSpecific objective 9: Logistics \u2013 capacity building  \n \nAchievements \nDifferent trainings were provided to the Red Cross Society of Niger volunteers and staff. The sessions include a \ntraining that was held in Niamey for 15 members of the governance and executive branches of the National Society. \nThe five-day workshop covered issues such as project planning, logistics, preparedness and response, procurement, \nwarehousing and transport management as well as IT/telecommunications. During the last day of training, a visit to \nthe National Society\u2019s warehouse and a brainstorming session were undertaken about the future of logistics within \nthe Red Cross Society of Niger. Three days of training were also held for volunteers and staff members in Zinder, \nAgadez, Tillabery, Tahoua and Maradi.  \n \nAn emergency stock of 1,000 MT of cereals was pre-positioned for the Red Cross Society of Niger at its Niamey \nwarehouse. The emergency stock was treated as per Federation standards, with National Society staff members \ntrained in warehousing techniques. In the framework of the general logistics training, a specific module on \nwarehousing was provided. At the Red Cross Society of Niger Tahoua base, a logistics counterpart was fully \nintegrated into Federation activities.   \n \nSpecific objective 10: Relief-livelihoods capacity building in Niger. \n \nAchievements \n \nLivelihoods small grants programme \nThe small grants project was implemented by the Irish Red Cross in Agadez and divided into two parts; family \ngrants and collective grants for micro-projects. Family grants were meant to assist vulnerable families until the next \nrainy season and reinforce their coping mechanisms in future by contributing to replenishment of their household \n \n \n10\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \neconomy. Collective grants for micro-projects were oriented towards reinforcement of food security of local \ncommunities.  \n \nAfter a series of surveys and assessments, the Irish Red Cross, as the manager of the activity, decided to provide \ngrants to ten per cent of the vulnerable populations in each village (people aged over 60 years, and \npregnant/lactating women). Focus groups, with women, revealed that small animals were considered the highest \npriority to improve livelihood security; some women identified food as their greatest need while others indicated the \nneed for alternative sources of income, such as weaving palm frond for sale in the local market.  \nAccordingly, the Red Cross implemented a programme where staff, with support from branch volunteers, purchased \nsmall ruminants (sheep and goats) in bulk for distribution to targeted households. Beneficiaries participated in \nassessing the general health of the animals before they were purchased. Cereals were also purchased in bulk and \ngiven to extremely vulnerable households, based on family size. Finally, palm fronds were provided directly to \nwomen to make mats, and the Red Cross volunteers assisted in marketing.  This programme ended in August 2006. \n \nFood-for-work projects: In Mali, in addition to relief food distributions, \u2018food for work\u2019 and \u2018food-for-training\u2019 \nprogrammes were implemented up to end of November 2005. \u2018Food-for-work\u2019 and \u2018food-for-training\u2019 distributions \nwere made at the beginning and the end of the work/training sessions, and they aimed at protecting the child rations \nalready distributed. Among the food-for-work projects were dyke construction, reforestation, water pipe \nconstruction, irrigation, warehouse construction and market gardening.  \n \nFood-for-training projects were mainly oriented towards HIV/AIDS sensitization, elimination of illiteracy and \nnutrition education. Beneficiaries received 2 kg of cereals and 75 grammes of oil per day when participating in a \nfood-for-work project and 1.2 kg of cereals and 45 grammes of oil per day when participating in a training session. \n \nIn Niger, following an initial assessment and discussions with community members on the most important needs at \nthe community level, food-for-work projects were designed and implemented in Agadez, in Filingue-Abala, and in \nTahoua.   \n \nA pilot project was undertaken in Fadama and Tillimoune, two villages north of Abala and close to the Mali border. \nActivities in both villages focused on provision of water and agriculture. They included: \n\u2022 \nSoil recuperation and improvement of a water catchment in Fadama and Tillimoune; \n\u2022 \nRehabilitation of a community well in Fadama and Tillimoune. \n \nBy July 2006, 1,113 workers had benefited from the food-for-work projects in Tillimoune and Fadama. In \nTillimoune, the projects included well rehabilitation and soil rehabilitation (through construction of half moons), \nconstruction of stone walls and planting trees. Rehabilitation of wells was completed, and 2,630 forest half moons, \n5,008 agricultural half-moons and 4.16 km of stone lines were installed. More than 6,000 trees were planted. In \nFadama, in addition to soil rehabilitation, there were three additional projects; one to deepen a pond (to make it a \nyear-round catchment area), the second to build four micro-dams (to slow down water flow so that water would \nfilter down to the water table), and the third to rehabilitate a deep well. All projects were identified by communities. \nWell reconstruction and the four micro-dams were completed.  \n \nIn Tahoua, four food-for-work projects were conducted to recuperate 80 hectares of land through the construction of \nhalf-moons and planting acacia trees. A total of 23,710 half-moons were dug, and 5,200 acacia trees were planted.  \nA rotation system for teams of workers was established so that each team would work for one day out of three, \nleaving the other two days available for working in their fields. At least 719 persons, including 77 branch volunteers \nand 10 technical specialists, worked in the projects and received sufficient food to meet their family needs for one \nmonth.    \n \nImpact \nThe assistance provided to 5,713 vulnerable families at a critical juncture in the yearly cycle, helped them with the \nmeans to manage their immediate economic needs and re-establish their households on a more secure financial \nfooting.  \n \n \n \n11\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nThe relatively substantial cash grant provided vulnerable households with a choice in coping mechanisms. \nEvaluation reports indicate that families that benefited from small grants used the funds to buy foodstuffs, cattle and \nnecessary household implements, such as carts, and to pay off debts. This showed that households prioritized \ninvesting in their longer-term economic viability over shorter-term needs. \n \nHouseholds were not constrained to pay off debts by selling their harvest at a loss. Cash-in-hand enabled agro-\npastoralist communities to decide when to buy and when to sell, thereby ensuring better management of their \nharvest and livestock. It also enabled stockpiling of millet, to help families apportion their harvest to last them \nthrough the lean period, which soon followed.  \n \nConstraints \nUnfortunately, one of the dams constructed in Fadama did not hold, and there was insufficient time remaining in the \nproject to rehabilitate the dam. In addition, trees were not planted as expected and the Red Cross eventually gave \n2,000 of the trees to the Department of the Environment for planting elsewhere. \n \nSpecific objective 11 (Reporting-media-communications \u2013 advocacy and public information): Promote and \ndisseminate within the target audience the activities highlighted in the Supplementary Plan of Action \u2013 \nAppeal Extension and overall Sahel operation.    \n \nAchievements  \nThroughout the operation, the Federation information delegate held regular interviews with international, local and \nregional media. The delegate also accompanied camera teams to the field, and briefed journalists interested in the \nrelief operation as well as communication teams of Partner National Societies. In addition, key documents, \nphotographs and fact sheets were developed and shared with partners, stakeholders and national societies interested \nand/or involved in the operation. Articles were published on the Federation\u2019s website and a dedicated section \nfocusing on the Sahel food crisis was created.  \n \nContinuous training was provided to the Federation regional information officer, in Dakar, on the professional role \nforeseen within the Federation, focusing on information-gathering during disasters and reporting. This aimed at \nensuring continuity of highlighting forgotten disasters once the operation closed. In addition, documents on \ninformation management during disasters \u2013 produced by the Inter-Americas Communicators Network \u2013 were shared \nwith the Red Cross Society of Niger press officer.  \n \nTraining packages on promotion of Humanitarian Values and Red Cross principles, including information on the \nCode of Conduct of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief, were given to \nFederation staff and Partner National Societies working in the Sahel operation (in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger). \nThe aim was to reinforce knowledge of Red Cross principles and values among the volunteers involved in the food-\ncrisis operation, especially newcomers. \n \nCoordination \n \nWithin the Red Cross/Red Crescent Movement \nCoordination and cooperation within logistics, human resources and programme support was established between \nthe Federation and Participating National Societies, in particular the French Red Cross, the Irish Red Cross, the \nQatari Red Crescent, the Saudi Arabian Red Crescent and the Spanish Red Cross. As the Sahel operation developed, \ncontact was also established with the Iranian Red Crescent as it has a long-standing and noteworthy presence in \nNiger.  \n \nThe Federation regional delegation in Dakar facilitated and coordinated the deployment of Regional Disaster \nResponse Team (RDRT) members from West Africa. Staff provided by the National Societies of Algeria, Benin, \nCameroon, Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Nigeria and Togo played a crucial role since the \nearliest stages of the operation. Their involvement was pivotal for the development, implementation and success of \nvarious activities. It signalled the reliable expertise available throughout different countries in the region.   \n \nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) provided regular security updates. ICRC also provided \ntraining for volunteers from the Red Cross Society of Niger, in Tahoua.  \n \n \n12\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nWith beneficiaries \nAt the local and regional-country level, relief and supplementary feeding activities were undertaken in collaboration \nwith local and provincial authorities to facilitate coordination while underlining and ensuring respect for \nFundamental Principles of the Red Cross Movement. Heads of villages were, in particular, closely linked to the Red \nCross/Red Crescent response due to their pivotal role within communities.   \n \nWith government agencies \nAn effective working relationship was established with the main governmental bodies involved in the crisis \u2013 such \nas Cellule de Crise Alimentaire (CCA) and Syst\u00e8me d\u2019Alerte Pr\u00e9coce (SAP) \u2013 and with key government of Niger \nministries, in cooperation with the Red Cross Society of Niger. The ministries included the Ministry of Health and \nthe Ministry of Community Development.  In Tahoua (Niger), the Red Cross/Red Crescent worked very closely \nwith regional government health staff. This facilitated competency development and the eventual transfer of \nsupplementary feeding centres to the government.    \n \nWith other agencies \nSince the onset of the Sahel operation, the Federation collaborated closely with United Nations agencies \n(particularly in the organization of transport services and provision of food assistance), and the broader \nhumanitarian community, most notably in the health sector.   \n \nThe operation had a series of partnerships, which enabled the Red Cross/Red Crescent to draw on other forms of \nexpertise, as well as additional financial resources to support the activities. Collegial support for various Federation \nactivities was received from organizations such as Concern, GOAL, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), Oxfam and \nSave the Children-UK.   \n \nThrough the Transport Support Unit (TSU), the Federation developed relationships with WFP and its implementing \npartners. Greater numbers of beneficiaries were assisted on a timely basis through food distribution and food-for-\nwork than would have been possible had the TSU not been established.   \n \nThe Spanish Red Cross in Maradi had an agreement with MSF-France, where severely malnourished children \nwould be referred to MSF for treatment, and moderately malnourished children seeking assistance at MSF clinics \nwould be referred to Red Cross clinics for treatment.   \n \nThe British Red Cross contracted the services of the University of Arizona to monitor the impact of the cash \ndistribution project in Tanout. This had the effect of bringing in highly qualified experts who provided objectivity in \nmonitoring data and impact. \n \nConcern referred children (when they have reached 80 per cent of their weight) from its acute malnutrition feed \ncentres to the Red Cross/Red Crescent. Concern invested considerable time to ensure that its supplementary feeding \nactivities did not overlap those of the Red Cross.   \n \nNational Society Capacity Building \nIn general, all sectors of the intervention contained elements for training and support of volunteers and staff of Host \nNational Societies. Among the various aspects of the Sahel operation, a network of more than 360 volunteers was \ntrained as part of the initial emergency response in the areas of relief, health care, logistics, administration, \ntelecommunications, reporting and media relations. In a relatively short time, their knowledge of the Red Cross/Red \nCrescent Movement was greatly enhanced. As key players in an operational partnership, volunteers and staff \nconsistently showed their dedication and skills.     \n \nThe counterpart system was very successful, especially in supplementary feeding centres, mobile health clinics, \ncommunity health, water and sanitation, and food-for-work. In all these sectors, activities were implemented using \ncounterparts from local Red Cross branches.   \n \nTraining of Burkinabe Red Cross Society volunteers in registration and distribution procedures was undertaken in \nconjunction with its first aid section. In each province of Burkina Faso, a team of 30 volunteers supported by a \nsupervisor, team leader and logistician was established. Volunteers were then deployed to the various target areas or \n\u2018d\u00e9partements\u2019 within the province and the supervisor/team leader continued to work alongside the volunteers. \n \n \n13\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nWith support from the operation, the Tahoua branch of the Red Cross Society of Niger rehabilitated its offices, \nincreased its professional competency and strengthened its financial management capability. A number of \nvolunteers were trained and they in turn provided support to local health centres and other key community health \nactivities. The branch also developed its logistics capacity to provide necessary support, when needed, in Tahoua. \n \nMonitoring and evaluation \nWith a variety of Movement actors continuing their presence in Niger following the closure of the operation, a \nfocused evaluation was commissioned by the Federation to review efforts undertaken under the Sahel Operation. \nThe evaluation particularly emphasized on Niger (which was the most affected country, and where the operation \nreally focused on), to help determine how the remaining actors can capitalize on their presence, interests and \nstrengths in reflection of continuing needs in the country.  \n \nThe evaluation focused on three thematic areas: appropriateness of the disaster response intervention; processes; \nand relationships. The findings indicate that through the Sahel operation, the Red Cross/Red Crescent contributed to \nthe reduction of the short-term effects of the drought. The Red Cross/Red Crescent intervention helped to reduce \nfood insecurity and addressed the needs of moderately malnourished children, among others. \n \nFor further information specifically related to this operation please contact: \n\u2022 \nIn Dakar: Alasan Senghore, Federation Head of Zone for West and Central Africa, Dakar; email: \nalasan.senghore@ifrc.org; telephone +221.869.36.41; fax +221.860.20.02. \n \nAll International Federation assistance seeks to adhere to the Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and \nRed Crescent Movement and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO's) in Disaster Relief and is committed to the \nHumanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards in Disaster Response (Sphere) in delivering assistance to the most \nvulnerable. \n \nFor longer-term programmes in this or other countries or regions, please refer to the Federation\u2019s Annual Appeal. \nFor support to or for further information concerning Federation programmes or operations in this or other \ncountries, or for national society profiles, please also access the Federation\u2019s website at http://www.ifrc.org\n \n \n<Final financial report below; click here to return to the title page> \n \n \n14\nSelected Parameters\nReporting Timeframe\n2005/4-2007/8\nBudget Timeframe\n2005/4-2007/8\nAppeal\nM05EA015\nBudget\nAPPEAL\nAll figures are in Swiss Francs (CHF)\nFinal Financial Report\nM05EA015 - BURKINA FASO, MALI, MAURITANIA & NIGER: FOOD INSEC\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies\nI.

This situation resulted in a severe food crisis and heightened malnutrition in many \nlocations of Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger. Niger was, however, the most affected country.  \n \nAs part of its overall stewardship for West Africa, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent \nSocieties regional delegation in Dakar closely monitored the situation. Through several assessment and support \nmissions to the concerned countries, the delegation assisted National Societies in disseminating warnings of \nupcoming food insecurity to affected communities as well as governments, national and international organizations.  \n \nAs the food security situation became increasingly alarming, the \nregional delegation deployed a three-member team comprising one \nconsultant and two Regional Disaster Response Team (RDRT) \nmembers to carry out a detailed assessment of the food security \nsituation in Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali and Mauritania and to assist \nthe National Societies in identifying their role in addressing the issue \nconsidering \ntheir \nexperience \nand \noperational \ncapacities. \nIn \ncoordination with the UN Office for the Coordination of \nHumanitarian Affairs (OCHA), World Food Programme (WFP), the \nUN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), other organizations \nand governments, the team developed recommendations for the \nFederation on ways of providing support to National Societies in the \nregion and possible interventions. Based on the findings of the \nassessments and information collected through secondary sources, the \nmain justifications for an emergency intervention were as follows: \nVillagers in drought-hit Tigar, Niger, gather \nfor a Red Cross food distribution. A \ncombination of drought and a locust invasion \nleft many parts of the Sahel region \ndesperately \nshort \nof \nfood. \nMark \nSnelling/British Red Cross. \n\u2022 \nLoss of life: There was increasing evidence from M\u00e9decins Sans \nFronti\u00e8res (MSF) and other sources that children were dying \u2013 \nparticularly in Niger \u2013 as a result of the crisis in the Sahel region;    \n\u2022 \nFood and health loss: Agricultural production in Niger during 2004 was severely affected by the locust invasion \nand drought.  Estimates from an assessment mission by the government, WFP, Famine Early Warning System \nNetwork (FEWS NET) and the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control (CILSS1) in March 2005 \nconcluded that 2.5 million people \u2013 approximately 20 percent of Niger\u2019s population \u2013 were food insecure and \nrequired food assistance.  The loss in cereal production was approximately 15 per cent compared to the average \nannual production over the last five years, or a grain deficit of about 225,000 metric tonnes (MT) for the year \n2005. While Mali, Burkina Faso and Mauritania were not as severely affected, they were still part of the same \ndisaster situation and needed support to discourage a further deterioration of the situation;     \n\u2022 \nLivestock loss: Livestock \u2013 particularly cattle, horses and donkeys that were least resistant to drought \u2013 were \nseverely affected by fodder shortages. Many dead carcasses were visible throughout the hardest hit parts of \nNiger and Mali.  Dakoro, Filingu\u00e9 and Ouallam were among the worst affected zones.  While no epidemics \nwere reported  (only food deficiencies and parasites) it was noted that coping capacities appeared to be stretched \nto the limit by continuing high cereal prices that translated into poor terms of trade in the selling livestock to \nbuy cereals; \n\u2022 \nEmployment loss: Because of food insecurity, many people were migrating in increasing numbers to larger \npopulation centres in search of employment or means to gain money. Population movement was considered a \nnegative indicator as it could have a detrimental impact on families, communities and security. \n \nOn 22 July 2005, the International Federation launched an Emergency Appeal seeking CHF 18,243,483 to assist \n44,400 households over a period of six months. While the Federation Emergency Appeal put forth immediate \nresponse efforts, those longer-term in nature were left for further definition pending programme support, general \nactivity progress and evolution of the crisis at hand.  After initial emergency response efforts and with the structural \nnature of the crisis in Niger and other affected countries becoming clearer, it became apparent that the initial six-\nmonth timeframe incorporating emergency, post-crisis and developmental activities was too tight. By mid-January \n2006, activities undertaken as part of the emergency appeal had reached 644,525 people (beyond the revised target \n \n1 In French: Comit\u00e9 Inter-Etate pour la Lutte contre la S\u00e9cheresse au Sahel \n \n \n2\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nof 536,000 beneficiaries), mainly due to a high response to supplementary feeding for malnourished children and \ntheir families. The appeal was subsequently revised; the number of targeted people was increased to 76,571 families \n(536,000 beneficiaries) and the timeframe was extended until end of July 2006. In line with these changes, the \nAppeal budget was increased to CHF 31,242,371 (USD 24,051,094 or EUR 19,798,714) on 13 April 2006.  \n \nAmong the various programmes of the Sahel operation, principal beneficiaries included moderately malnourished \nchildren and their families, households suffering from severe food shortages, the elderly, the ill, orphans and \ndisadvantaged pastoralist communities. Through the Red Cross/Red Crescent intervention, the assisted populations \nbenefited from sensitization and education campaigns as well as community projects such as food-for-work, \nbuilding and repair of wells, health, nutrition and hygiene training, skill enhancement and professional \ndevelopment. \n \nThis operation was effectively planned and managed, and achieved clear impact. Based on the initial success in \ndelivering the intended assistance, initiatives were undertaken to implement plans previously outlined in the appeal, \nwith a reasonable expectation that donors would support the activities and meet their obligations accordingly. \nUnfortunately, the anticipated funding support did not materialize, but the Federation had already engaged and \ncommitted with the National Societies and other partners. As a result, the operation was faced with a considerable \ndeficit (see attached final financial report). While this may raise valid questions over financial management and \ndiscipline, the Federation will resolve the situation transparently, working with the concerned National Societies. \nFor further questions related to this issue, please refer to the list of <contact details> provided at the end of this \nreport. \n \nAnalysis of the operation - objectives, achievements and impact \n \nGoal: Provide support to the affected Red Cross and Red Crescent national societies in order to decrease and \nfurther prevent vulnerability to food insecurity and malnutrition by immediately responding in the form of \nlivelihood interventions for 76,571 households (536,000 beneficiaries) over a six-month period. [As per the \nRevised Plan of Action of 7 August 2005]. \n \nSpecific objective 1 (Relief - general food distributions): Distribute a monthly general food ration to 76,571 \nhouseholds (536,000 people) in Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger.   \n \nAchievements \n \nBurkina Faso: Food distributions in the Northern provinces of Burkina Faso were completed by the end of April \n2006. However, following a field visit undertaken by the Federation, Burkinabe Red Cross Society and the \nLuxembourg Red Cross in Yatenga, Loroum and Soum provinces in December 2005, it was found that the northern \nregions still experienced severe effects of the drought as well as \nattacks by caterpillars and seed-eating birds. In some areas, food \nstocks could potentially last only two months since some producers \nwere already eating their new crop while they harvested. The \nassessment mission concluded that distributions needed to be \ncontinued in these areas, especially Oudalan, Soum, Yatenga, Loroum, \nSoum and Oudalan provinces.  \n \nConsequently, a supplementary round of distributions was done in \nSoum, Oudalan and Yatenga, reaching 19 sites and 8,984 households \nwith approximately 998 metric tonnes (MT) of foodstuffs. Rations \ncomprised of the following: 70 kg of millet, 20 kg of rice, 15 kg of \nniebe and 6 litres of vegetable oil per household in Oudalan Province; \n60 kg of millet or sorghum, 30 kg of rice, 15 kg of niebe and 6 litres of \nvegetable oil in Soum and Yatenga provinces.  \n \nMali: Mali Red Cross distributed commodities provided by the World \nFood Programme (WFP). In total, 41,413 children, aged between 5 \nand 59 months, benefited from 1.491 MT of food.  \nThe Niger Red Cross distributes essential \nfood aid to villagers in Tigar. According to \nUN statistics, some 3.6 million of Niger\u2019s 12 \nmillion inhabitants were directly affected by \nthe food crisis. Mark Snelling/British Red \nCross. \n \n \n3\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nMali Red Cross, supported directly by the Federation, provided an additional 329 MT of food. Four distribution \nrounds were planned over 120 days and took place at 104 sites among 14 communes in Timbuktu, Goundam and \nGourma-Rharous. They targeted 10,226 children, of whom 4,036 were female. Rations were composed of 250 \ngrammes of enriched flour (CSB), 30 grammes of oil and 20 grammes of sugar per child per day.  \n \nNiger: The Federation completed its two rounds of general food distribution in Tillab\u00e9ri and Agadez provinces by \nmid-October 2005, in line with the onset of the year\u2019s harvest. An estimated 143,558 beneficiaries were reached and \nover 3.327 MT of foodstuffs distributed. \n \nGiven the immense distances involved both within and between distribution areas, two logistical hubs were \nestablished for each distribution centre \u2013 one in Filingu\u00e9 and one in Agadez. A dedicated group of Red Cross \nSociety of Niger volunteers were recruited and trained for the operation (130 in Tillab\u00e9ri and 50 in Agadez). The \nRed Cross teams worked in close cooperation with village heads and local leaders in identifying and confirming \nbeneficiaries.  \n \nImpact \nThe nutritional status of vulnerable families was markedly increased. It was estimated that calorie intake had been \nraised from 90 calories per person to 1,777 calories per person, which was within the accepted norm of 2,100 \ncalories per person. \n \nConstraints \nTargeting and initial estimates of numbers of beneficiaries for general food distributions were based on government \ncensus figures. As a result, beneficiary numbers were generally underestimated and members of semi-nomadic \ncommunities were not always included. Furthermore, relief teams identified a number of \u2018gap villages\u2019 with \nequivalent needs that had not been included in lists initially received. A degree of \u2018on-the-spot diplomacy\u2019 and \nflexibility ended up being demonstrated by Federation relief teams in allocating rations and adjusting second round \ndistributions in order to meet the needs of additional people vulnerable throughout a number of communities. \n \nThe distances and remote nature of many villages created logistical challenges and an increased workload for relief \ndistributions \u2013 in one case mules were used as a local means of transportation for general food distributions.  In \nBurkina Faso, the greatest constraints were distances between the capital, Ouagadougou, and main areas of \noperation, posing a challenge in purchasing, transport and general programme implementation. Distributions in \nareas such as Soum were complicated by the existence of large areas of swampy land following the rainy season, \nmaking access highly difficult. To counter the problem, distribution points were established in the nearest dry areas. \nAlthough new distribution points posed greater travelling distances for beneficiaries, they remained accessible by \ncart enabling the local population to still receive much needed food assistance in a fairly timely manner.   \n \nIn Mali, transport was challenging as some villages were not reachable by road; \u2018pinasses\u2019 or motorized pirogues \nwere, therefore, rented. Unfortunately, pinasses could not ensure totally secure transportation since some goods \ncould become wet and unusable and others could be lost overboard. Furthermore, the duration of distributions in \nMali was prolonged due to difficulties in the identification of children as many bear similar names.  In addition, due \nto migration habits, organizing distributions for nomadic populations was generally a challenge.  \n \nSpecific objective 2: (Health \u2013 supplementary feeding): Provide basic health services through emergency \nsupplementary feeding for targeted vulnerable children aged under five years, to a total population of 24,500 \nin Niger. \n \nAchievements \nRed Cross/Red Crescent supplementary feeding programmes were operational in Niger since 1 August 2005 in \ncooperation with the French Red Cross (who already had an established bilateral programme in Niger), the Qatari \nRed Crescent and the Spanish Red Cross in the regions of Tahoua, Maradi, Zinder, Tanout and Agadez. By the \nclose of September 2005, the government of Niger had a new protocol in place, establishing its responsibility for the \nnutritional situation in the country. By that time, the Federation was questioning the merits of a \u2018parallel system\u2019 of \na supplementary feeding being conducted by the international humanitarian community as a long-term venture. It \nbecame clear that the Federation, in partnership with the Red Cross Society of Niger needed to assist government \nregional authorities in making their health centre personnel more tangibly responsible for the management of \nmalnutrition. \n \n \n4\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nBy mid-January 2006, 48,525 moderately malnourished children had been treated through the Red Cross/Red \nCrescent supplementary feeding centres at Tahoua, Maradi, Zinder, Agadez-Arlit and Tanout. An additional 3,825 \nmoderately malnourished children were treated between February and September 2006. In addition to the treatment \nrations for malnourished children (UNIMIX), their families received protection rations, bringing the total number of \nbeneficiaries to 291,150. The protection rations were composed of 100 kg of cereals, 50 kg of beans and four litres \nof vegetable oil per month. This ration was halved after the harvest (end of October 2005), and was discontinued \ncompletely in December 2005.   \n \nConstraints  \nThe caseload of supplementary feeding centres was higher than \nexpected, putting additional strain and workload on Red Cross \nvolunteers \nand \ndelegates. \nThe \noverwhelming \nresponse \nto \nsupplementary feeding and the provision of family protection rations \n\u2013 the combination of a health programme and relief activity \u2013 posed \nchallenges for ensuring quality programming, adequate training and \nservice provision, general staff supervision and management.  \nNiger Red Cross Society volunteers weighing \na little child. According to the Niger Red \nCross, many children were moderately or \nseverely \nmalnourished \nin \nNiger. \nOlav \nSaltbones/Norwegian Red Cross. \n \nAnother main challenge for the supplementary feeding treatment \nprogramme was the prevalence of malaria and other endemic diseases \nin Niger. As a result, the health programme of the Qatari Red \nCrescent involved additional training and treatment for malaria as \npart of its supplementary feeding activities. Vaccination programmes \nwere also implemented at a number of the feeding centres. \n \nThe protection ratios that were being provided to families with \nmalnourished children were ultimately discontinued due to the \nfollowing reasons:  \n\u2022 \nAnecdotal evidence indicated that children were been kept \ndeliberately malnourished so that their families could receive \nthe rations;  \n\u2022 \nObservations by staff and volunteers showed that some \nmothers took their children to the health centres only when \nthere were distributions of family rations;  \n\u2022 \nSome women gave their children purgative plants to keep \nthem thin, thus eligible for the programme. \n \nSpecific objective 3 (relief \u2013 cash distribution): As per the Revised Plan of Action of 7 August 2005, a cash \ndistribution was foreseen targeting 20,000 beneficiaries, or 4,000 households, to communities in Niger and \nMali. \n \nAchievements \nAs of 18 November 2005, cash distributions were completed at Tanout assisting 34,278 beneficiaries (5,713 \nhouseholds) in 88 villages and three pastoralist settlements. One-time cash grants of XOF 120,000 (approximately \nUSD 240 or EUR 182), were provided to each household.  \n \nAs part of the cash project \u2013 and through a unique partnership between the Federation, British Red Cross, Swedish \nRed Cross and University of Arizona \u2013 a monitoring regime began in the aftermath of the distributions to assess \ntheir impact at household, village, market and regional levels. Quantitative and qualitative information gathering \nalso focused on the impact of cash distributions on the nutritional status of recipient and non-recipient households. \nThe report of the evaluation is available upon request.  \n \nIn summary (according to the Phase III evaluation report), households that received financial support from the Red \nCross/Red Crescent were less likely to be indebted (4.9 per cent compared to 25.3 per cent). Among indebted \nhouseholds, cash recipients were lesser in debt compared to those who did not receive cash (average amount to be \nrepaid XOF 24,514 for cash villages and XOF 64,625 for control villages). These findings support reports from \n \n \n5\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nPhase I and II evaluations, which indicated that households used financial resources from the Red Cross cash \ndistribution to pay off loans and reduce indebtedness. The reports are available upon request. \n \nImpact \nAssistance was provided to 5,713 vulnerable families at a critical juncture in the yearly cycle, by providing them \nwith the means to manage their immediate economic needs and reestablish their households on a more secure \nfinancial footing.  \n \nConstraints \nOpposition to cash distribution by some non-governmental and international organizations, coupled with unclear \nsupport from the authorities, led to a degree of confusion that came close to derailing the project. A last-minute \nmessage received from the Governor of Zinder, conveyed through the Head of the CCA (who is responsible to the \nCabinet and Office of the Prime Minister), temporarily suspended cash distributions just prior to the scheduled start \nof the project. Following extensive negotiations, a formal agreement with the government was reached, sanctioned \nby the President of Niger, with full support from the Red Cross Society of Niger. \n \nLack of banking facilities in Tanout and surrounding remote villages led to some logistical and security challenges. \nHowever, these were successfully addressed and the project progressed well. \n \nSpecific objective 4 (Logistics, administration and telecoms): Immediately augment the existing Red Cross \nand Red Crescent National Societies with logistical, administrative and telecommunications infrastructure in \nthe four different countries of the Sahel operation. \n \nAchievements \n \nIT/Telecoms: The Mali Red Cross benefited from the presence of an IT/Telecoms delegate during the first six \nmonths of the Sahel operation when the main installations were done. The Sahel operation IT/Telecoms team \ninstalled a wide area network/local area network (WAN/LAN) with an access point and Internet connection for \napproximately 15 users. A counterpart from the National Society was recruited and trained; before leaving Mali, the \nSahel operation IT/Telecom team handed over to the IT/telecom counterpart who would ensure proper maintenance \nof the equipment, with support from the team in Niamey. A total of five laptops and three radios were provided by \nthe British Red Cross and two new desktops, one network printer and radios by the Federation.  \n \nIn Mauritania, the Federation installed three high frequency (HF) and very high frequency (VHF) bases in Zoucrete, \nNouakchott and Nema/Nouadibhou, and two mobile HF and VHF units (with 15 handsets), in response to \npopulation movements.   \n \nIn Burkina Faso, the British Red Cross provided the Burkinabe Faso \nRed Cross Society with four laptops, two Thuraya satellite phones as \nwell as HF and VHF equipment in two vehicles.  \n \nIn addition to IT/telecom bases that already existed in Niger, the \nFederation provided the Red Cross Society of Niger with one laptop, \ntwo desktops, one network printer, two HF and VHF bases for Niamey \nand Tahoua as well as two HF and VHF mobiles and 15 handsets. An \nIT/telecom counterpart was recruited and trained, and an Internet \nconnection was provided. \n \nLogistics: Overall, logistics of the operation functioned well, despite \nsome under-staffing and staff change challenges. The fleet in Niger \nran at full capacity, with 31 Federation vehicles and 11 rental vehicles \ncovering over 200,000 km a month, often over difficult terrain. The \noperation in Mali was also a logistical success, as commodities were delivered to a much dispersed set of \nbeneficiaries, also over very challenging terrains.   \nInternational Federation officials preparing \nTSU trucks for food distributions in Niger. \nOlav Saltbones/Norwegian Red Cross. \n \n \n \n6\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \n                                                \nFor the distributions that were undertaken in Burkina Faso, 333.5 MT of rice, sorghum and oil were transported \nfrom the Red Cross Society of Niger/Federation/Transport Support Unit (TSU) warehouse in Niamey to the various \ndistribution sites. Two Federation logisticians were dispatched from Niger to support the relief delegate and the \nBurkinabe Red Cross Society to complete the distributions and to assess the National Society\u2019s capacities.  \n \nIn Filingue-Abala (Niger), as part of food-for-work activities, a sub-office and warehouse were temporarily \nestablished at Abala.  Ten Transport Support Unit trucks were dispatched as part of the food-for-work effort, and a \nstock of 200 MT of cereals was put in place. TSU operational hubs were based in Tahoua and Maradi, with \napproximately 20 trucks in each location and 30 trucks remaining in Niamey.  \n \nLogistics training in Niamey was completed, with similar training (for about 10 people per session for 3 days) \nundertaken in Zinder, Agadez, Tillabery, Tahoua and Maradi. The warehouse and compound of the Red Cross \nSociety of Niger were also renovated to include a new entry zone, an improved grading to protect the area against \nground water and rains as well as new roofing. \n \nApart from supporting the Federation and other Red Cross/Red Crescent activities, the TSU supported WFP \ncooperating partners such as Action Against Hunger (ACF 2), Concern and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) \nthrough \u2018cluster deployments\u2019 of up to ten trucks.  \n \nImpact \nThe logistics team supported Federation operations and Partner National Society programmes, concentrating its \nactivities on the general food distributions and supplementary feeding programmes. Though the enormous distances \nthat had to be covered (compounded by an often unreliable supply chain) posed some challenges, beneficiary needs \nwere met in a timely and regular manner. \n \nConstraints \nIn Burkina Faso, internal and external communications were hampered by a lack of equipment, difficult and \nunreliable connections and a lack of available technical personnel to pursue implementation of IT/telecoms activities. \n \nThe long distances involved in transporting goods across the region, the quality of the transport infrastructure and \nweather conditions at certain times, compounded by an unreliable supply chain, posed challenges for operational \nlogistics. Despite the constraints, the Federation possessed a dynamic logistics team able to overcome obstacles so \nthat beneficiary demands could be met in a timely and regular manner.   \n \nAmong logistical challenges, one difficulty was the imposition by the Government of Niger on limits of tonnage for \ntrucks passing through Niamey. Shipments for a number of organizations, most notably the Federation, WFP and \nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), were blocked in transit due to the new regulations which levied fines of \nXOF 10,000 per metric tonne on cargo exceeding 25 metric tonnes. In response, the Federation sought and received \na temporary exemption for its food commodities that were already en route. \n \nThe receipt of food commodities was a complicated process since limited information tended to be provided by \nfreight forwarders regarding expected delivery times. Discussions with freight forwarders on behalf of Sahel \nOperation staff improved the situation, resulting in the ultimate receipt of all goods.  \n \nSpecific objective 5 (Relief - livestock interventions for Mali and Niger): As per the Revised Plan of Action of \n7 August 2005, it was anticipated that 5,000 pastoralists would be assisted in Mali and Niger.   \n \nAchievements  \nThe food distributions also provided the opportunity to undertake parallel activities in the area of livestock health \nand support. On 11 November 2005, livestock vaccination sensitization campaigns started in different villages in the \nSalam Region, in cooperation with the Malian Ministry of Livestock. Radio stations broadcasted campaign \ninformation in four local languages and heads of villages were contacted as part of the sensitization process.   \n \n \n2 In French: Action Contre la Faim \n \n \n7\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \n                                                \nIn turn, 15,897 heads of livestock were vaccinated in Salam and Gourma Rharous. The number of cattle attended to \nwas well above the original target of 10,000, despite reticence amongst pastoralists in identifying exact numbers of \ncattle due to taxation implications.  \n \nIn December 2005 and January 2006, two rounds of fodder distributions were undertaken in the Salam Region. \nTheir purpose was to ensure livestock fodder consumption, prevent livestock sales on the markets and guarantee \nfodder in cold periods. There were two main breeder selection criteria; at least one malnourished child in the \nhousehold and breeders had to own between 10 and 50 livestock heads. Roughly 10,400 livestock heads benefited \nfrom fodder distributions totalling 180 MT. \n \nImpact \nReinforcing vulnerable livestock, thereby enabling on-going viability of pastoralist communities through a livestock \nvaccination programme and the distribution of fodder, enabled them to build up their livestock capacity so as to \nsurvive the extreme temperatures period that begins in December. \n \nSpecific objective 6 (Relief - cereal bank support for Mali and Niger): As per the Revised Plan of Action of 7 \nAugust 2005, it was anticipated that food stocks could be placed at cereal banks in 250 of the worst affected \ncommunities in Mali and Niger. \n \nAchievements \nAs monitoring progressed, it became evident that cereal banks could be a means of further assisting people affected \nby drought in Niger. Preliminary investigations suggested that as many as 50 villages could benefit from cereal \nbanks as a means of enhancing their longer-term food security.   \n \nA project manager from the British Red Cross arrived in Niger to develop a pilot cereal bank project, along with \nacademic staff from the University of Arizona. In addition to the funding provided by the British Red Cross, the \nFederation agreed to provide logistics support for the research and implementation phases of the pilot project.  \n \nVillage lands were identified, sites were confirmed using the Global Positioning System (GPS) and official \ndocuments were signed by village chiefs who authorized allocation of the land. A total of 21 cereal banks were \nconstructed in villages around Tanout; construction was completed in July, 2006, before the onset of the rainy \nseason. The banks were built using cement bricks, concrete and steel. The rationale for using these materials to \nbuild the cereal banks, instead of local traditional materials, was based on research done (reflecting on the use of \nboth types of products) with an important factor being the reduction of overhead costs, thus contributing to longer-\nterm sustainability. \n \nTwenty one village committees for cereal bank management were created and a three-day management training was \nconducted. Several items, including tables, chairs, notebooks, pens and cleaning products for the cereal banks, were \nprovided. Since the cereal banks began operating during the lean season, rice sales started immediately after \nconstruction was completed and management committees were in place.   \n \nAccording to the original design, households were required to pay a XOF 500 membership fee in order to purchase \ncereals3 from the banks. In Farak, 200 households were active in the cereal banks, with each household eligible to \npurchase up to five tias per week.  Funds collected from the sales were to be kept until after the harvest, when prices \ndropped significantly and more cereals could be purchased for use in the next lean season. \n \nConstraints \nDue to the requirement to pay membership fees, it was found out that 30 per cent of households were not accessing \nfood in the banks by July 2006. Management committees were primarily comprised of men, and it was not possible \nto ascertain whether the most vulnerable households were represented in the committees. Given that literacy and \nnumeracy skills were some of the criteria used to select members of the committee, it is likely that the most \nvulnerable households were not represented. In Farak, CARE had been working for two years, providing support to \n \n3 During a post-operation evaluation of the project, a meeting with women in Farak village revealed that they were paying XOF \n850 per tia of rice in the banks, compared to XOF 1,100 in the market.    \n \n \n8\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \n                                                \nwomen\u2019s village banks. The skills gained by the women in managing cereal banks could have been capitalized upon \nin setting up the management committee for the Red Cross-supported cereal banks. Women, who had proven their \nability to manage the savings of village banks and had gained the trust of their members, could have formed the \nmanagement committees. The Red Cross has realized this and in future, such interventions shall take into \nconsideration available skills and gender balance. \n \nSpecific objective 7 (Health \u2013 post-emergency health for Niger): Sustainable health interventions to promote \nresilience and improve the longer-term health of the most vulnerable are advocated.   \n \nAchievements \n \nMalnutrition strategy \nAs part of the technical support-transition process for the integrated health centres (CSI)4, and on behalf of the \nFederation and the Red Cross Society of Niger, 60 health officers and 30 general staff were trained in malnutrition \nscreening and treatment (according to the national protocol), and supplementary feeding stock management. The \ntraining and integration of services was undertaken in 15 health centres, including Hadachimo, Mogheur, Dangona, \nMaboya, Ill\u00e9la, Bagaroua, S\u00e9hia, T\u00e9baram, Toulou, Edir, Dandoutchi, Taja\u00e9, Dandaji and Moull\u00e9la. As part of the \nintegration strategy, the Federation trained 40 Red Cross Society of Niger volunteers who will continue providing \ntechnical support to community health centres.  \n \nBecause chronic malnutrition is a result of specific behaviours towards food and hygiene, the main focus of the \nSahel operation health team at Tahoua was educating key people (matrons within communities and Red Cross \nSociety of Niger volunteers) as agents who would sensitize and mobilize the local populations. To this end, 60 \nmatrons and 40 Red Cross Society of Niger volunteers working with the CSI in Tahoua and Ill\u00e9la districts were \ntrained in nutrition information, education and communication (IEC).  \n \nMatrons were considered key people as they are usually the traditional advisers of mothers on children\u2019s health \nissues within communities. Training sessions for matrons typically lasted two days while for volunteers took one \nday. A training of trainers (ToT) session for Red Cross Society of Niger counterparts in nutrition and education was \nalso undertaken through the health programme in Tahoua. In addition, 150 training sessions on nutrition followed in \nJuly 2006.  \n \nMobile health \nFollowing a pilot mobile health team project initiated in October 2005 in the Tahoua area, a Memorandum of \nUnderstanding was entered into with the regional health authorities for on-going delivery of much needed basic \nhealth care to remote communities that lacked access to basic health services.  \n \nIn November 2005, three mobile clinics were set up in Tahoua, with five trained volunteers in each. They visited 48 \ndifferent sites (120 villages in three different health districts), often together with the major (nurse) from the nearest \nhealth centre. During the visits, they vaccinated children aged under five years, made prenatal and post natal \nconsultations, sensitized women on basic health issues, conducted malnutrition screening, and provided de-worming \nmedication.  \n \nBetween March and August 2006, 9,888 children had been vaccinated and 1,906 de-wormed. The vaccination \ncoverage in the region where the clinics were operating was more than 90 per cent. 2,674 prenatal consultations \nwere held where women were vaccinated, and 3,731 malnourished children were identified and sent to malnutrition \ncentres. About 8,196 women were reached with messages/information on breastfeeding issues, weaning, diarrhoea, \nvaccination of new-borns, malaria, use of mosquito nets, food-environmental-and body hygiene, and family \nplanning. \n \nImpact \nThe mobile health teams contributed to the improvement of access to primary health in the Tahoua region. Due to \nimproved access, the vaccination coverage amongst children under 11 months was increased in the region and in \nother areas of operation under the supplementary feeding programmes. \n \n \n4 In French: Centre de Sant\u00e9 Int\u00e9gr\u00e9 (CSI) \n \n \n9\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nConstraint \nDistances to these remote villages were great, sometimes between 150 and 230 km, and road access was non-\nexistent.  \n \nSpecific objective 8: Water and sanitation (WatSan), Niger \n \nAchievements \nFollowing an assessment mission undertaken in September 2005, a number of potential water and sanitation \nactivities were outlined that were to be implemented immediately or over the mid-term and longer-term. Among the \nactivities were the following: construction and rehabilitation of well; construction and rehabilitation of school \nlatrines; and construction and rehabilitation of family latrines. With assistance from the Swedish Red Cross, \nimplementation of WatSan activities began. The programme was later scaled up with financial support from the \nQatari Red Crescent and it is being implemented after the close of the Sahel operation.  \n \nEighty volunteers from the Red Cross Society of Niger were trained in Participatory Hygiene and Sanitation \nTransformation (PHAST), a methodology that builds on people\u2019s innate ability to address and resolve their own \nproblems. In turn, the Red Cross volunteers trained community-based volunteers in the targeted villages; the Red \nCross volunteers were equipped with motorbikes to facilitate easy reach (five villages per volunteer). More than 70 \nof these volunteers conducted sensitization activities in 235 villages of Tahoua, Tillabery and Zinder. In Tahoua and \nin Filingu\u00e9, 110 water management committees have been formed and their members trained. The committees are \nnow responsible for managing the wells constructed/rehabilitated under the project. Similar committees will be \nestablished in Zinder. The WatSan activities will continue until end of July 2007. \n \nImpact \nHygiene promotion, using the PHAST methodology, in Tahoua contributed towards cholera prevention \u2013 in 2006 \u2013 \nin areas where cholera is endemic, such as in Bouza.   \n \nConstraints \nAt the beginning, implementation of activities was slow because there were no community-based volunteers in the \ntargeted villages. Due to delays in implementation, water and sanitation activities should continue for two years to \nassure the ownership of the infrastructure by the beneficiaries. \n \nSpecific objective 9: Logistics \u2013 capacity building  \n \nAchievements \nDifferent trainings were provided to the Red Cross Society of Niger volunteers and staff. The sessions include a \ntraining that was held in Niamey for 15 members of the governance and executive branches of the National Society. \nThe five-day workshop covered issues such as project planning, logistics, preparedness and response, procurement, \nwarehousing and transport management as well as IT/telecommunications. During the last day of training, a visit to \nthe National Society\u2019s warehouse and a brainstorming session were undertaken about the future of logistics within \nthe Red Cross Society of Niger. Three days of training were also held for volunteers and staff members in Zinder, \nAgadez, Tillabery, Tahoua and Maradi.  \n \nAn emergency stock of 1,000 MT of cereals was pre-positioned for the Red Cross Society of Niger at its Niamey \nwarehouse. The emergency stock was treated as per Federation standards, with National Society staff members \ntrained in warehousing techniques. In the framework of the general logistics training, a specific module on \nwarehousing was provided. At the Red Cross Society of Niger Tahoua base, a logistics counterpart was fully \nintegrated into Federation activities.   \n \nSpecific objective 10: Relief-livelihoods capacity building in Niger. \n \nAchievements \n \nLivelihoods small grants programme \nThe small grants project was implemented by the Irish Red Cross in Agadez and divided into two parts; family \ngrants and collective grants for micro-projects. Family grants were meant to assist vulnerable families until the next \nrainy season and reinforce their coping mechanisms in future by contributing to replenishment of their household \n \n \n10\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \neconomy. Collective grants for micro-projects were oriented towards reinforcement of food security of local \ncommunities.  \n \nAfter a series of surveys and assessments, the Irish Red Cross, as the manager of the activity, decided to provide \ngrants to ten per cent of the vulnerable populations in each village (people aged over 60 years, and \npregnant/lactating women). Focus groups, with women, revealed that small animals were considered the highest \npriority to improve livelihood security; some women identified food as their greatest need while others indicated the \nneed for alternative sources of income, such as weaving palm frond for sale in the local market.  \nAccordingly, the Red Cross implemented a programme where staff, with support from branch volunteers, purchased \nsmall ruminants (sheep and goats) in bulk for distribution to targeted households. Beneficiaries participated in \nassessing the general health of the animals before they were purchased. Cereals were also purchased in bulk and \ngiven to extremely vulnerable households, based on family size. Finally, palm fronds were provided directly to \nwomen to make mats, and the Red Cross volunteers assisted in marketing.  This programme ended in August 2006. \n \nFood-for-work projects: In Mali, in addition to relief food distributions, \u2018food for work\u2019 and \u2018food-for-training\u2019 \nprogrammes were implemented up to end of November 2005. \u2018Food-for-work\u2019 and \u2018food-for-training\u2019 distributions \nwere made at the beginning and the end of the work/training sessions, and they aimed at protecting the child rations \nalready distributed. Among the food-for-work projects were dyke construction, reforestation, water pipe \nconstruction, irrigation, warehouse construction and market gardening.  \n \nFood-for-training projects were mainly oriented towards HIV/AIDS sensitization, elimination of illiteracy and \nnutrition education. Beneficiaries received 2 kg of cereals and 75 grammes of oil per day when participating in a \nfood-for-work project and 1.2 kg of cereals and 45 grammes of oil per day when participating in a training session. \n \nIn Niger, following an initial assessment and discussions with community members on the most important needs at \nthe community level, food-for-work projects were designed and implemented in Agadez, in Filingue-Abala, and in \nTahoua.   \n \nA pilot project was undertaken in Fadama and Tillimoune, two villages north of Abala and close to the Mali border. \nActivities in both villages focused on provision of water and agriculture. They included: \n\u2022 \nSoil recuperation and improvement of a water catchment in Fadama and Tillimoune; \n\u2022 \nRehabilitation of a community well in Fadama and Tillimoune. \n \nBy July 2006, 1,113 workers had benefited from the food-for-work projects in Tillimoune and Fadama. In \nTillimoune, the projects included well rehabilitation and soil rehabilitation (through construction of half moons), \nconstruction of stone walls and planting trees. Rehabilitation of wells was completed, and 2,630 forest half moons, \n5,008 agricultural half-moons and 4.16 km of stone lines were installed. More than 6,000 trees were planted. In \nFadama, in addition to soil rehabilitation, there were three additional projects; one to deepen a pond (to make it a \nyear-round catchment area), the second to build four micro-dams (to slow down water flow so that water would \nfilter down to the water table), and the third to rehabilitate a deep well. All projects were identified by communities. \nWell reconstruction and the four micro-dams were completed.  \n \nIn Tahoua, four food-for-work projects were conducted to recuperate 80 hectares of land through the construction of \nhalf-moons and planting acacia trees. A total of 23,710 half-moons were dug, and 5,200 acacia trees were planted.  \nA rotation system for teams of workers was established so that each team would work for one day out of three, \nleaving the other two days available for working in their fields. At least 719 persons, including 77 branch volunteers \nand 10 technical specialists, worked in the projects and received sufficient food to meet their family needs for one \nmonth.    \n \nImpact \nThe assistance provided to 5,713 vulnerable families at a critical juncture in the yearly cycle, helped them with the \nmeans to manage their immediate economic needs and re-establish their households on a more secure financial \nfooting.  \n \n \n \n11\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nThe relatively substantial cash grant provided vulnerable households with a choice in coping mechanisms. \nEvaluation reports indicate that families that benefited from small grants used the funds to buy foodstuffs, cattle and \nnecessary household implements, such as carts, and to pay off debts. This showed that households prioritized \ninvesting in their longer-term economic viability over shorter-term needs. \n \nHouseholds were not constrained to pay off debts by selling their harvest at a loss. Cash-in-hand enabled agro-\npastoralist communities to decide when to buy and when to sell, thereby ensuring better management of their \nharvest and livestock. It also enabled stockpiling of millet, to help families apportion their harvest to last them \nthrough the lean period, which soon followed.  \n \nConstraints \nUnfortunately, one of the dams constructed in Fadama did not hold, and there was insufficient time remaining in the \nproject to rehabilitate the dam. In addition, trees were not planted as expected and the Red Cross eventually gave \n2,000 of the trees to the Department of the Environment for planting elsewhere. \n \nSpecific objective 11 (Reporting-media-communications \u2013 advocacy and public information): Promote and \ndisseminate within the target audience the activities highlighted in the Supplementary Plan of Action \u2013 \nAppeal Extension and overall Sahel operation.    \n \nAchievements  \nThroughout the operation, the Federation information delegate held regular interviews with international, local and \nregional media. The delegate also accompanied camera teams to the field, and briefed journalists interested in the \nrelief operation as well as communication teams of Partner National Societies. In addition, key documents, \nphotographs and fact sheets were developed and shared with partners, stakeholders and national societies interested \nand/or involved in the operation. Articles were published on the Federation\u2019s website and a dedicated section \nfocusing on the Sahel food crisis was created.  \n \nContinuous training was provided to the Federation regional information officer, in Dakar, on the professional role \nforeseen within the Federation, focusing on information-gathering during disasters and reporting. This aimed at \nensuring continuity of highlighting forgotten disasters once the operation closed. In addition, documents on \ninformation management during disasters \u2013 produced by the Inter-Americas Communicators Network \u2013 were shared \nwith the Red Cross Society of Niger press officer.  \n \nTraining packages on promotion of Humanitarian Values and Red Cross principles, including information on the \nCode of Conduct of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief, were given to \nFederation staff and Partner National Societies working in the Sahel operation (in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger). \nThe aim was to reinforce knowledge of Red Cross principles and values among the volunteers involved in the food-\ncrisis operation, especially newcomers. \n \nCoordination \n \nWithin the Red Cross/Red Crescent Movement \nCoordination and cooperation within logistics, human resources and programme support was established between \nthe Federation and Participating National Societies, in particular the French Red Cross, the Irish Red Cross, the \nQatari Red Crescent, the Saudi Arabian Red Crescent and the Spanish Red Cross. As the Sahel operation developed, \ncontact was also established with the Iranian Red Crescent as it has a long-standing and noteworthy presence in \nNiger.  \n \nThe Federation regional delegation in Dakar facilitated and coordinated the deployment of Regional Disaster \nResponse Team (RDRT) members from West Africa. Staff provided by the National Societies of Algeria, Benin, \nCameroon, Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Nigeria and Togo played a crucial role since the \nearliest stages of the operation. Their involvement was pivotal for the development, implementation and success of \nvarious activities. It signalled the reliable expertise available throughout different countries in the region.   \n \nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) provided regular security updates. ICRC also provided \ntraining for volunteers from the Red Cross Society of Niger, in Tahoua.  \n \n \n12\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nWith beneficiaries \nAt the local and regional-country level, relief and supplementary feeding activities were undertaken in collaboration \nwith local and provincial authorities to facilitate coordination while underlining and ensuring respect for \nFundamental Principles of the Red Cross Movement. Heads of villages were, in particular, closely linked to the Red \nCross/Red Crescent response due to their pivotal role within communities.   \n \nWith government agencies \nAn effective working relationship was established with the main governmental bodies involved in the crisis \u2013 such \nas Cellule de Crise Alimentaire (CCA) and Syst\u00e8me d\u2019Alerte Pr\u00e9coce (SAP) \u2013 and with key government of Niger \nministries, in cooperation with the Red Cross Society of Niger. The ministries included the Ministry of Health and \nthe Ministry of Community Development.  In Tahoua (Niger), the Red Cross/Red Crescent worked very closely \nwith regional government health staff. This facilitated competency development and the eventual transfer of \nsupplementary feeding centres to the government.    \n \nWith other agencies \nSince the onset of the Sahel operation, the Federation collaborated closely with United Nations agencies \n(particularly in the organization of transport services and provision of food assistance), and the broader \nhumanitarian community, most notably in the health sector.   \n \nThe operation had a series of partnerships, which enabled the Red Cross/Red Crescent to draw on other forms of \nexpertise, as well as additional financial resources to support the activities. Collegial support for various Federation \nactivities was received from organizations such as Concern, GOAL, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), Oxfam and \nSave the Children-UK.   \n \nThrough the Transport Support Unit (TSU), the Federation developed relationships with WFP and its implementing \npartners. Greater numbers of beneficiaries were assisted on a timely basis through food distribution and food-for-\nwork than would have been possible had the TSU not been established.   \n \nThe Spanish Red Cross in Maradi had an agreement with MSF-France, where severely malnourished children \nwould be referred to MSF for treatment, and moderately malnourished children seeking assistance at MSF clinics \nwould be referred to Red Cross clinics for treatment.   \n \nThe British Red Cross contracted the services of the University of Arizona to monitor the impact of the cash \ndistribution project in Tanout. This had the effect of bringing in highly qualified experts who provided objectivity in \nmonitoring data and impact. \n \nConcern referred children (when they have reached 80 per cent of their weight) from its acute malnutrition feed \ncentres to the Red Cross/Red Crescent. Concern invested considerable time to ensure that its supplementary feeding \nactivities did not overlap those of the Red Cross.   \n \nNational Society Capacity Building \nIn general, all sectors of the intervention contained elements for training and support of volunteers and staff of Host \nNational Societies. Among the various aspects of the Sahel operation, a network of more than 360 volunteers was \ntrained as part of the initial emergency response in the areas of relief, health care, logistics, administration, \ntelecommunications, reporting and media relations. In a relatively short time, their knowledge of the Red Cross/Red \nCrescent Movement was greatly enhanced. As key players in an operational partnership, volunteers and staff \nconsistently showed their dedication and skills.     \n \nThe counterpart system was very successful, especially in supplementary feeding centres, mobile health clinics, \ncommunity health, water and sanitation, and food-for-work. In all these sectors, activities were implemented using \ncounterparts from local Red Cross branches.   \n \nTraining of Burkinabe Red Cross Society volunteers in registration and distribution procedures was undertaken in \nconjunction with its first aid section. In each province of Burkina Faso, a team of 30 volunteers supported by a \nsupervisor, team leader and logistician was established. Volunteers were then deployed to the various target areas or \n\u2018d\u00e9partements\u2019 within the province and the supervisor/team leader continued to work alongside the volunteers. \n \n \n13\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nWith support from the operation, the Tahoua branch of the Red Cross Society of Niger rehabilitated its offices, \nincreased its professional competency and strengthened its financial management capability. A number of \nvolunteers were trained and they in turn provided support to local health centres and other key community health \nactivities. The branch also developed its logistics capacity to provide necessary support, when needed, in Tahoua. \n \nMonitoring and evaluation \nWith a variety of Movement actors continuing their presence in Niger following the closure of the operation, a \nfocused evaluation was commissioned by the Federation to review efforts undertaken under the Sahel Operation. \nThe evaluation particularly emphasized on Niger (which was the most affected country, and where the operation \nreally focused on), to help determine how the remaining actors can capitalize on their presence, interests and \nstrengths in reflection of continuing needs in the country.  \n \nThe evaluation focused on three thematic areas: appropriateness of the disaster response intervention; processes; \nand relationships. The findings indicate that through the Sahel operation, the Red Cross/Red Crescent contributed to \nthe reduction of the short-term effects of the drought. The Red Cross/Red Crescent intervention helped to reduce \nfood insecurity and addressed the needs of moderately malnourished children, among others. \n \nFor further information specifically related to this operation please contact: \n\u2022 \nIn Dakar: Alasan Senghore, Federation Head of Zone for West and Central Africa, Dakar; email: \nalasan.senghore@ifrc.org; telephone +221.869.36.41; fax +221.860.20.02. \n \nAll International Federation assistance seeks to adhere to the Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and \nRed Crescent Movement and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO's) in Disaster Relief and is committed to the \nHumanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards in Disaster Response (Sphere) in delivering assistance to the most \nvulnerable. \n \nFor longer-term programmes in this or other countries or regions, please refer to the Federation\u2019s Annual Appeal. \nFor support to or for further information concerning Federation programmes or operations in this or other \ncountries, or for national society profiles, please also access the Federation\u2019s website at http://www.ifrc.org\n \n \n<Final financial report below; click here to return to the title page> \n \n \n14\nSelected Parameters\nReporting Timeframe\n2005/4-2007/8\nBudget Timeframe\n2005/4-2007/8\nAppeal\nM05EA015\nBudget\nAPPEAL\nAll figures are in Swiss Francs (CHF)\nFinal Financial Report\nM05EA015 - BURKINA FASO, MALI, MAURITANIA & NIGER: FOOD INSEC\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies\nI.

Refer to http://www.ifrc.org/docs/appeals/annual06/MAA63001.pdf \nOperational Summary: The main agricultural growing season is drawing to a close in southern Africa, with crops \nat a stage of maturity and early harvests resulting in improved availability of food at household levels and in rural \nmarkets. However, concerns remain high in Zimbabwe (where it is likely that cereals will need to be imported \nagain) and in isolated pockets of Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique, Lesotho and Swaziland (which received low/late \nrain, or excessive rain that caused flooding, wiping away crops planted).   \n \nThe Red Cross actors in the region have worked hard to meet the humanitarian challenges since October 2005, with \nall seven national societies having bilateral agreements with the World Food Programme (WFP), their respective \ngovernments and/or donor national societies (outside of this appeal process) to distribute food to over 300,000 most \nvulnerable people in the region. Despite the low level of funding received for this Appeal, the Malawi Red Cross \nSociety managed to expand its final double distributions in April/May to reach some 130,000 supplementary \nfeeding beneficiaries and to provide a one-off distribution within the food-for-work project to a further 28,000 \nbeneficiaries building health structures.  The Zambia Red Cross Society also started distributing food in April, with \nthis project expected to expand to 27,500 beneficiaries during the May and June distributions.   \n \nSouthern Africa: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA023; Operations Update no. 8 \n \n \n \n \n2 \nWith the exception of Zambia, all agricultural starter packs have been distributed and national societies (NS) are \nfocusing on distributing vegetable seeds at the end of May. Preliminary findings from the Federation\u2019s regional \npost-harvest survey are being analyzed to ascertain the impact the harvested crops have had on household food \nsecurity. In Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe, implementation of water and sanitation (WatSan) \nprojects is progressing well, with several projects nearing completion. \n \nThe third regional food security coordination meeting, held in Johannesburg on 5 April, developed further \nlivelihood projects which are now starting to get underway. These include Zambia\u2019s cash voucher/transfer and \nlivestock projects and Zimbabwe\u2019s orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) supplementary feeding project as well \nas a small-scale irrigation project.   \n \nAt the end of April, an operational review commenced; it is being conducted by an evaluation team of four \nmembers who are holding discussions with key external counterparts, the Federation Secretariat, the regional \ndelegation in Harare and the seven1 NS as well as conducting field visits in Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and \nZimbabwe. The aim of the exercise is to review the performance of the operation and to identify lessons learned. \nThe exercise will also highlight the way forward, with discussions including a possible extension of longer-term \nprojects outlined in the Appeal or the integration of these projects into other programmes. The full findings of the \noperational review will be shared with all counterparts at the end of May 2006. \nThis operation is aligned with the International Federation's Global Agenda, which sets out four broad goals \nto meet the Federation's mission to \"improve the lives of vulnerable people by mobilizing the power of \nhumanity\". \n \nGlobal Agenda Goals: \n\u2022 \nReduce the numbers of deaths, injuries and impact from disasters. \n\u2022 \nReduce the number of deaths, illnesses and impact from diseases and public health emergencies. \n\u2022 \nIncrease local community, civil society and Red Cross Red Crescent capacity to address the most \nurgent situations of vulnerability. \n\u2022 \nReduce intolerance, discrimination and social exclusion and promote respect for diversity and \nhuman dignity. \n \nFor further information specifically related to this operation please contact:  \n\u2022 \nIn Zimbabwe: Fran\u00e7oise Le Goff, Head of Southern Africa Regional Delegation, Harare; Email: \nfrancoise.legoff@ifrc.org; Phone: +263.4.70.61.55, +263.4.72.03.15; Fax: +263.4.70.87.84 \n\u2022 \nIn Geneva: Terry Carney, Federation Regional Officer for Southern Africa, Africa Dept., Geneva; Email: \nterry.carney@ifrc.org; Phone: +41.22.730.42.98, Fax: +41.22.733.03.97 \n \nAll International Federation assistance seeks to adhere to the Code of Conduct and is committed to the \nHumanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards in Disaster Response in delivering assistance to the most \nvulnerable.

The most affected \ncountries were Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe.   \n \nOperational developments \nThe months of April/May bring the end of the hunger season, as crops planted earlier start to be harvested, resulting \nin improved food security since households begin to access seasonal crops. According to the Famine Early Warning \nSystem Network (FEWSNET), general preliminary crop assessments in Southern Africa indicate improvements \nwhen compared to the previous two years, with near-normal or above-normal seasonal rainfall totals. Emergency \nrelief programmes being implemented in the region are gradually being scaled-down during the April to June \nperiod, when it is likely that only very targeted distributions will continue in several countries/vulnerable pockets. \nZimbabwe is likely to face further food shortages amidst a rapidly declining socio-economic environment. Lesotho \nand Swaziland do not have good harvest prospects too but Malawi\u2019s crop estimates indicate an 87% maize \nproduction increase over the last year.  Zambia\u2019s and Mozambique\u2019s harvests are also expected to improve, with the \nrespective governments\u2019 crop forecasting surveys being conducted in May.  \n \nAs highlighted in the operational summary of this report, various countries as well as pockets in some countries will \nhave very poor harvests as a result of late rains or excessive rains that resulted in severe flooding. Official crop \nsurveys and national vulnerability assessments are expected to be completed by mid-June in all countries included \nin this Appeal. This information will form the basis for any further interventions related food insecurity.       \n \nIt should be noted that this Appeal is not only responding to a situation of food insecurity caused by erratic rainfall \npatterns in 2004/5, but also by the chronic burden of HIV/AIDS and weakened government capacities, with the so \ncalled \u2018triple threat\u2019 destroying vulnerable families. Whilst the \u2018hunger season\u2019 is over and crops have begun to be \nharvested, the \u2018triple threat\u2019 still exists for a high proportion of vulnerable beneficiaries relying on the Red Cross \ninterventions (those registered for the HIV/AIDS home-based care programmes, OVCs, people who are older, the \nchronically sick, people with disabilities, etc).    \n \nRed Cross and Red Crescent action - objectives, progress and impact \n \nOverall goal: To assist some 1,483,900 vulnerable beneficiaries in Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, \nSwaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe with food security, water and sanitation projects and to reinforce coping \nmechanisms (promoting livelihoods). \n \nFood Assistance \n \nObjective: To meet the immediate food needs of vulnerable individuals in Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, \nNamibia, Swaziland, Zambia, and Zimbabwe until the next harvest in 2006. \n \nProgress/Achievements (activities implemented within this objective) \nFunding constraints have resulted in lesser food being provided than outlined in the Emergency Appeal.  However, \nthe Malawian and Zambian operations have been able to implement fairly substantial food relief distributions from \nthe Emergency Appeal funds to the benefit of those in most need.  Additionally, the Zimbabwe Red Cross Society is \njust about to embark on a small-scale OVC supplementary feeding operation for some 600 children. \n \nOver the reporting period, the Malawi supplementary feeding programme was expanded to just over 130,000 \nbeneficiaries and the Zambia Red Cross Society started distributing food to 16,000 beneficiaries in April. The \ndistributions will be increased to support some 27,500 by May/June.  The total number of beneficiaries receiving \nfood within this objective will therefore be in excess of 150,000.   \n \nAll national societies involved in this operation have partnership agreements with WFP/governments/DFID or PNS \nto distribute food to the most vulnerable in their respective countries. These agreements enabled an additional \n310,000 beneficiaries to receive monthly food rations at the peak of the crisis. Consequently, the national societies \nfeel that they have made a positive impact on households trying to survive southern Africa\u2019s latest humanitarian \ncrisis. \n \n \nSouthern Africa: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA023; Operations Update no. 8 \n \n \n \n \n4 \nProcurement of food and logistics for Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe  \nThe final items for Malawi\u2019s supplementary feeding and food-for-work programmes, procured through the Finnish \nRed Cross/Federation, were incoming during the reporting period, with no new procurements now taking place. The \nlogistics operation went smoothly as it was enhanced by the fact that Malawi Red Cross Society\u2019s FS operation now \nhas its own warehouse. However, a truck transporting approximately 28,000 litres oil was hijacked in April; the lost \noil will be replaced by the insurance company in May. Except for the oil, the Zambia Red Cross Society\u2019s items \u2014\nprocured through the Finish Red Cross/Federation\u2014 arrived at the end of March in time for distribution in April. \nThe Zimbabwe Red Cross Society/Federation also procured fortified maize, CSB, beans, oil, soya mince, sugar, \npeanut butter and kapenta for the OVC supplementary feeding programme. During the week starting 8 May, \nfortified maize and peanut butter were delivered to the Red Cross warehouse in Harare, with all the other items \nstored in the supplier\u2019s warehouse. A quarter of all quantities were delivered to Bindura in the first two weeks of \nMay, followed by 50% of goods designated for the two distribution centres in Masvingo. \n \nTable 1: Status of Federation/Finnish Red Cross- procured food items   \n \nCountry \nOperation \nStatus \nMaize (MT) Pulses (MT)\nOil (lt) \nCSB (MT)\nNotes \nMalawi Supplementary Ordered \n3003 \n601 \n300,304 \n901 \nProcured by Finnish RC \nMalawi  \nIncoming \n3003 \n601 \n300,128 \n901 \n176lt oil (short only) \nMalawi Food-for-work Ordered \n281.5 \n28.15 \n0 \n0 \n \n \n \nIncoming \n281.5 \n28.15 \nn/a \nn/a \nConcluded \nZambia Supplementary Ordered \n805.6 \n135 \n72,200 \n224 \nFinnish RC/Federation  \n \n \nIncoming \n436 \n135 \n26,400 \n90 \nOngoing \n \nMalawi Red Cross Society\u2019s supplementary feeding programme \nThe third and last round of double-ration distributions under the Malawi Red Cross Society\u2019s supplementary food \nprogramme commenced on 3 April 2006, targeting an extra 10,370 households and focusing on an additional four \ndistricts - Karonga and Kasungu (in the Northern Region) and Dowa and Ntchisi (in the Central Region). This \nexpansion was made possible by additional incoming funds from donors. The distributions will be concluded \ntowards the end of May, when the final batch of cooking oil is incoming.

A possible forth centre will be opened in Masvingo. \nThese children are extremely vulnerable\u2014 HIV positive, sick or \nliving in child-headed households. The centres are within the HBC \nprojects and the OVC are cared for in the centres from 8 am to 1 pm \nMonday to Friday. They will be provided with breakfast, mid-\nmorning snacks and lunch. In April, baseline data was collected for \neach child and monitoring/reporting tools were developed. Food \ndistributions will start towards the end of May.   \n \nPhoto: OVC with two of their volunteer care facilitators, attending the OVC Day Centre in Bindura. \n \nReinforcing self-reliance and coping mechanisms (livelihoods) \n \nObjective: To re-enforce or rebuild self-reliance and to restore their positive coping mechanisms through \nfood-for-work/food-for-assets (income generating opportunities), cash transfers, targeted agricultural \nsupport, and the provision of vegetable garden drip kits. \n \nProgress/Achievements (activities implemented within this objective) \nTo date, focus has been placed on two areas of operation under this objective. First, the distribution of agricultural \nstarter packs in all seven countries (supporting the livelihoods of just under 40,000 households/some 200,000 \nbeneficiaries) and second, a food-for-work project in Malawi (where some 5,630 households/28,150 beneficiaries \nreceived food rations in exchange for construction work at community-based health care centres).  \n \nAt the 5 April Johannesburg FS coordination meeting, additional national society initiatives to reinforce self-\nreliability were discussed. They included backyard gardens, cash/voucher transfer projects, small-scale irrigation \nprojects, provision of livestock (goats/chickens) and vegetable/herb gardens next to health clinics.   \n \nAgricultural starter packs \nThis component of the food security operation is almost complete. National societies have distributed maize or \nwheat seeds, a mixture of vegetable seeds and top/basal fertilizers as follows: Zambia distributed vegetable seeds \nonly with funds from this appeal, so these will not be distributed until the end of May/early June, after maize is \nharvested; Zimbabwe\u2019s top fertilizer was all distributed but basil fertilizer (which is used before the planting season) \narrived too late, it will therefore be distributed at the end of this programme in time for the next planting season. All \nother agricultural starter pack activities have been completed, with the Federation-designed post-planting survey \nbeing carried out in operational areas to ascertain potential yields.   \n \nTable 4: Status of the distribution of agricultural starter packs \n \nCountry \nNo of households \nCereals/Pulses \nVeg Seeds \nFertilizers \nLesotho \n5,000 \nCompleted \nCompleted \nCompleted \nMalawi  \n16,747 \nCompleted \nCompleted \nCompleted \nMozambique  \n1,250 \nCompleted \nCompleted \nCompleted \nNamibia  \n2,000 \nCompleted \nCompleted \nCompleted \nSwaziland \n1,938 \nCompleted \nCompleted \nCompleted \nZambia  \n3,000 \nN/A \nEnd May/early June N/A \nZimbabwe  \n7,565 \nCompleted \nCompleted \nCompleted/stored \n \nMalawi Red Cross Society\u2019s food-for-work project \nThe Malawi Red Cross Society, in partnership with the Netherlands Red Cross (NLRC), has been implementing a \ncommunity-based health care programme (CBHCP) in Kasungu, Dowa and Ntchisi districts targeting 120,000 \nbeneficiaries since October 2003. The NLRC has supported the food-for-work component of the CBHCP through \nthis Appeal. All the 281.5 MT of maize and 28.15 MT of pulses procured were incoming, with a total of 5,630 \nhouseholds receiving food rations of 50 kg maize and 5 kg pulses each between 20 and 28 March in support of  \nvolunteers involved in constructing health centres.  A complete relief report will be provided in the next update. \n \n \nSouthern Africa: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA023; Operations Update no. 8 \n \n \n \n \n6 \nZambia Red Cross Society\u2019s cash voucher/transfer project \nThe Zambia Red Cross Society/Federation contracted an external consultant to conduct a feasibility study aimed at \nidentifying the most suitable methodology and procedures for the proposed cash voucher/transfer project. Findings \nfrom the study will be presented in May. In the meantime, it was proposed that a pilot disbursement of funds takes \nplace during the first week of June, targeting 200 households in Livingstone. The project will expand to cover 600 \nhouseholds by September.   \n \nZambia Red Cross Society\u2019s livestock project \nHouseholds in three districts will receive goats and chickens between May and July 2006; a total of 300 goats and \n1,200 chickens are planned to be distributed. The first set of beneficiary households will pass on the first offspring \nof the goats (when at the mating stage of development) and chickens (at the pullet stage of development) to the next \nset of households. An independent consultant will be engaged to identify, purchase and transport the livestock to the \ndistribution points. The consultant will also be responsible for training staff and volunteers in basic goat and \nchicken rearing, focusing on feeding, housing as well as disease prevention and control. Given the threat of Avian \nInfluenza, all chickens will be purchased from the local districts therefore abiding to the ban on movement of birds. \n \nZimbabwe Red Cross Society\u2019s small-scale irrigation project \nTwo small-scale irrigation schemes are being developed by the Zimbabwe Red Cross Society/Federation, with the \naim of improving the livelihood of 90 vulnerable child-headed households (CHHs) in Chinhoyi and Banket districts \nby constructing boreholes and providing piping as well as seeds thus enabling the CHHs to have their own \nnutritional gardens. The Red Cross offices in Chinhoyi and Banket have 2.5 hectares of land each set aside for the \nproject. The availability of two boreholes, a water tank, piping, a piggery and a fowl run will make it possible to \nrear chicks and piglets as well as to produce vegetables and herbs. Training/technical assistance will also be a large \npart of the programme. In April, the Zimbabwe Red Cross Society and RD WatSan officers visited the two sites and \ncompiled a list of items to be procured. On 8 May, all bids were opened at the RD and suppliers were selected. \nSimultaneously provincial managers were hiring draught power (to clear the land) and selecting volunteers for \ntraining, whilst liaising with the government\u2019s Department of Agricultural Research and Extension Services \n(AREX). An agronomist is also being recruited for three months to promote best farming practices and to conduct \ntraining for the volunteers.   \n \nWater and Sanitation \n \nObjective: Ensure access to safe and adequate drinking water, borehole rehabilitation, sanitation, small-scale \nirrigation, latrine construction, and hygiene education by vulnerable individuals. \n \nProgress/Achievements (activities implemented within this objective) \n \nMalawi \nThe Malawi Red Cross Society will soon provide 4,500 beneficiaries \nwith a safe water supply and disseminate hygiene promotion to 30,000 \nbeneficiaries in TA Mwambo, Zomba district. The work is closely \ncoordinated with the ministries of health and agriculture. Activities \nwill include:  drilling 10 new boreholes and equipping them with hand \npumps; rehabilitating 8 water boreholes and equipping them with \nfunctioning hand-pumps and aprons; selecting and training 18 water \ncommittees for community-based management of each of the \nboreholes and training 36 hygiene promotion volunteers who will \nconduct 12 hygiene promotion sessions each, ultimately disseminating \ngood practices to 30,000 beneficiaries.  \n \nAt the end of April 2006, all the quotations for borehole work were \nopened for Zomba district, with the rehabilitation of non-functioning \nboreholes now in progress.   \n \nThe successful rehabilitation of this borehole \nhand-pump has provided clean water for these \nwomen in Zomba district, Malawi. \n \n \nMozambique  \nThe WatSan intervention is focused on Maputo, Gaza and Inhambane provinces. Activities will include: training of \n30 water point maintenance committees/volunteers; construction of 12 ground-level water tanks, 7 borehole aprons \nand 500 family latrines and the rehabilitation of 21 boreholes. To date a total of 19 volunteers attended a five-day \n \nSouthern Africa: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA023; Operations Update no. 8 \n \n \n \n \n7 \nparticipatory hygiene and sanitation transformation (PHAST) course, enabling them to promote hygiene education \nand maintain hand pumps in Gaza Province. Community organizations in the province also started selecting the \nwater committee members to be trained. The process of identifying water points to be rehabilitated and sites to \nconstruct water tanks in Gaza province were completed. Additionally, the rehabilitation of 14 water points was \ncompleted, with new parts and hand-pump components fitted. Cement for 500 latrine slabs is also being procured.   \n \nZambia  \nThe Zambia Red Cross Society will focus its WatSan activities in Sinazongwe and Secheke, where food \ndistributions are being implemented. A particular emphasis will be on Secheke district, which previously lacked \nWatSan support. Support will include: rehabilitation of 50 boreholes; construction of 50 community ventilation \nimproved pit (VIP) latrines and provision of over 2,000 sanitation platforms (SanPlats). Hygiene education and \npromotion using the PHAST methodology will also be conducted. An assessment mission for Sinazongwe was \ncompleted on 30 April while an assessment mission for Secheke was planned for May. WatSan items are also in the \nprocess of being procured. \n \nZimbabwe \nThe Zimbabwe Red Cross Society will target over 16,000 beneficiaries in Chikomba and Buhera districts. It will \nalso reach over 3,600 households with hygiene education, considering that Chikomba district was affected by a \ncholera outbreak this year. Both districts will have 2 new boreholes, 10 rehabilitated boreholes and 100 latrines \nconstructed. Plans are on course to recruit a WatSan technician to be based; the officer will start working on 1 June \n2006. Funds have been disbursed to the provinces, cement and the builders\u2019 tools have been purchased and 98 \nlatrines are at various stages of completion. Ten boreholes have been rehabilitated and two new boreholes were \nexpected to be completed by mid-May. To date, 14 builders and 10 hygiene promoters have been trained in \nChikomba, with the water point maintenance training planned for the first week of June. \n \nReinforcing capacities in assessing livelihoods, and food security monitoring and reporting \n \nObjective: To ensure that national society staff is well versed in livelihood and food security interventions \n \nProgress/Achievements (activities implemented within this objective) \n \nRegional delegation level \nAt the Harare regional delegate level, the following delegate/national staff positions were filled to support this \nintervention: an FS operations coordinator; FS roaming logistics delegate; FS reporting delegate and an FS finance \nofficer. Disaster management as well as finance and administration delegates are also working with the FS team to \nensure that the operation is implemented smoothly. At country levels, each national society apart from Namibia \nbenefited from a relief delegate, with a regional delegation officer allocated during the distribution of agricultural \nstarter packs. The Malawi operation also had a logistics delegate whose contract ended in mid-May. In addition, \nfrom mid-April, a second America Red Cross delegate was deployed to Lesotho (on a bilateral basis) to support the \ngeneral operation for a month.  \n \nNational society level workshops  \nIn Lesotho, an experienced FS relief officer was recruited and 80 LRCS volunteers were mobilized from the 8 \ndistricts involved in the distribution of the agricultural starter packs. The volunteers attended a distribution \nmanagement workshop in February. Recruitment was underway at the end of April to replace the LRCS\u2019s DM \ncoordinator. In Malawi, a coordinator, a logistician, a monitoring and evaluation officer as well as 2 food monitors \nwere recruited or allocated to each of the 5 districts, bringing the total to 25; 4 warehouse staff were also put in \nplace for the FS operation. In May, the FS coordination meeting also involved an internal review workshop in \nBlantyre for the team in the southern region. In Mozambique, a total of 75 volunteers and 6 FS field officers were \nemployed from mid-February and attended a three-day training session at the end of February. A team comprised of \n4 officers from the national society and the FS delegate is planning to visit Swaziland in June to share lessons \nlearned and experiences, to conduct field trips and to hold discussions, with a particularly focus on backyard garden \nprojects. \n \nIn Swaziland, a coordinator from the headquarters and 5 divisional coordinators were allocated to the FS operation, \nalthough several officers were suspended at the end of April. During April, the FS officer conducted a workshop on \nbackyard gardens and vegetable production. In Namibia, the Namibia Red Cross reallocated six staff and mobilized \n \nSouthern Africa: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA023; Operations Update no. 8 \n \n \n \n \n8 \n200 volunteers to work for the FS programme. The visiting regional logistics officer ran a vehicle and warehousing \ncapacity-building exercises at the end of February. In Zambia, national staff consisted of an FS relief coordinator, 3 \nFS district coordinators, 3 district coordinators, 3 FS logistics assistants, two drivers and over 100 volunteers. Of \nthese, 32 from Choma attended a FS induction and refresher workshop held on 26-27 April. In Zimbabwe, the \nFederation delegate now has an administrative assistant and the national society has recruited a FS WatSan officer \nwho will start working by 1 June.   \n \nImpact \n \nFood Assistance: All national societies have partnership agreements with WFP, DFID and PNSs which include \nfood components. Due to limited financial resources, this Appeal is currently focusing funding on food \ninterventions in Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Measuring the impact of the food component of the Malawi Red \nCross Society\u2019s operation is the responsibility of the newly-appointed monitoring and evaluation (M&E) officers at \nthe headquarters and district levels. Monitoring is conducted at the distribution points and follow-up household \nM&E tools have been introduced. The tools are analyzed on a monthly basis.  \n \nReinforcing self-reliance and coping mechanisms (livelihoods): The regional delegation\u2019s food security \nprogramme officer designed a post-planting survey with the aim of assessing the impact of this intervention. Data \ncollected includes number and types of crops planted, area planted by crop type, fertilizer applied, crop production \nand size of the households. The Malawi, Mozambique and Swaziland national societies have already conducted this \nsurvey. In Lesotho, preparations were underway to conduct the survey on 15-16 May, using 5-6 volunteers led by \nthe relief officer. The Zambia Red Cross Society will conduct the survey after distributing vegetable seeds in June. \nThe survey may not be conducted in Namibia due to a lack of human resources. Once all the data has been collected \nand analyzed, a consolidated report will be compiled and its results will be shared with all counterparts. The \nZimbabwe Red Cross Society has conducted a Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO) survey.  \n \nWater and sanitation: In accordance with SPHERE standards, the WatSan component of the operation will be \nevaluated for impact using beneficiary baseline surveys before and after each intervention.   \n \nReinforcing capacities in assessing livelihoods, and food security monitoring and reporting: The impact of this \nobjective will in part be measured by the review evaluation exercise which was being conducted in May by two \nconsultants. Initial results of the exercise are due by the end of May/beginning of June. The review report will be \nshared with all counterparts.  \n \nConstraints \nInsufficient funding is still a problem, with the Appeal receiving only 26.8% of the funds needed. Many of the \nplanned activities, especially provision of food, are now not going to be implemented at all. However, further funds \nare still incoming and new initiatives were highlighted at the FS coordination meeting held in Johannesburg in \nApril.   \n \nStaffing problems occurred over the reporting period in the Lesotho and Swaziland national societies, with several \nkey FS/DM staff either resigning or being suspended. This resulted in planning and implementation challenges. The \npresident of Zambia Red Cross Society was also suspended over the reporting period; this did not disrupt the FS \noperation. \n \nOperational review \nAn operational review is being conducted between the end of April and the end of May 2006, with funds from the \nSwedish Red Cross and the British Red Cross. A team of two consultants was joined by the secretary general of the \nMozambique Red Cross Society and the regional delegation\u2019s M&E officer, who visited Malawi, Mozambique, \nZimbabwe and Zambia operations and held discussions with internal and external counterparts. The team will hold \ntelephone conferences and meetings with key staff/delegates in the other four national societies as well as at the \nregional delegation and Secretariat levels.   \n \nThe general objective of the exercise is to review the performance of the operation and to asses its effectiveness and \nefficiency, with a view to provide lessons learned and a way forward.  Other issues to be addressed are:  \n\u2022 \nComparing the 2002 and 2005/6 food security operations and how lessons learnt were applied;  \n \nSouthern Africa: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA023; Operations Update no. 8 \n \n \n \n \n9 \n\u2022 \nConsidering the poor response by donors to this Appeal, to examine the consequences for the \nimplementation of programmes and the reasons which led to poor donor support; \n\u2022 \nExamining the overall operational approach in respect to logistical support and local procurement in the \ncrisis, to demonstrate if the set-up helped or hindered the provision of timely services; \n\u2022 \nExamining operational alliances/partnerships, in respect to the response to this operation. \n \nA comprehensive report will be produced by the end of May and will be shared with all counterparts.  The report \nwill also be discussed at the fourth Johannesburg FS coordination meeting scheduled for 10-14 July 2006. During \nthe meeting, the regional FS policy framework document will be developed further. \n \nFederation Coordination \nA third food security coordination meeting was held in Johannesburg on 5 April, bringing together FS delegates/NS \nrelief and programme coordinators, RD FS delegates/officers, the senior food security advisor from the Secretariat  \nand the British Red Cross\u2019s desk officer. In addition to general programme coordination, operational and budget \nupdates, the meeting focused on new livelihood initiatives, their corresponding budgets and the development of a \nfive-year food security strategic plan. \n \nOver the reporting period, the Federation Food Security Task Force met fortnightly in Harare to ensure that \ncoordination was maintained. Topics discussed included pledge updates, country operational updates, movement of \ndelegates, forthcoming field trips and meetings, the operational review, agricultural post-planting survey and \ndevelopment of new projects. Minutes of the meeting are available up on request to all involved in the operation.   \nAt country levels, each NS also held task force coordination meetings with key NS staff, PNSs and the Federation\u2014 \non a weekly or fortnightly basis and minutes were shared by all involved in the operation.   \n \nExternally, relevant regional delegation representatives attend the Regional Inter-agency Coordination Standing \nOffice and Head of Agency meetings, UNICEF/Ministry of Health Watsan Working Group meetings and other \ncoordination meetings. At country levels, WFP Food Security Coordination meetings, National Disaster \nManagement Unit Meetings and HIV and AIDS meetings\u2014 among others\u2014 are attended by key national society \nstaff and delegates on a regular basis. \n  \nCommunications \u2013 Advocacy and Public Information \nNational society information departments continued to support the food security operation through a number of \nmedia activities. The Zimbabwe Red Cross Society organized a media tour (for the local media) to highlight the \nplight of the most affected as well as the role of the Red Cross in food security interventions. A feature story was \npublished in the Herald and was aired on the national television. The Malawi Red Cross Society also arranged a \nmedia tour to cover food distributions, focusing on the impact of seed and cassava distributions in addressing long-\nterm food security problems. On 8 May, the president of Malawi received the senior staff of Malawi Red Cross \nSociety to discuss the work of the Red Cross. The meeting was broadcasted on all national TV and radio outlets. \n \nFollowing the food security coordination meeting held in Johannesburg IN April, a press release entitled \u201cRed Cross \nfood security operation in southern Africa on course despite poor funding\u201d was issued. The article was also posted \non Reuters AlertNet, IRIN and AEGIS among others. Two more stories on Zambia and Namibia were posted on the \nFederation\u2019s website: \u201cZambia Red Cross volunteers extend lifeline to people living with HIV and AIDS\u2019 and \n\u201cNamibian San people begin a new chapter with Red Cross seed distribution\u201d. The former focused on the role of \nvolunteers in the food security operation and the latter on the role played by the Red Cross food security operation \nin Namibia in an attempt to change the lives of the marginalized San community. \n \n \nContributions list below; click here to return to the title page. \n \n \nSouthern Africa - food insecurity\nANNEX 1\nAPPEAL No. 05EA023\nPLEDGES  RECEIVED \n09/05/2006\nDONOR\nCATEGORY\nQUANTITY\nUNIT\nVALUE CHF\nDATE\nCOMMENT\nCASH \nTOTAL COVERAGE\nREQUESTED IN APPEAL CHF ---------------------------------------->\n39,360,753\n26.8%\nAMERICAN - RC\n1,000,000\nUSD\n1,321,000\n06.02.06\nLESOTHO, MALAWI, ZIMBABWE, \nZAMBIA\nAUSTRALIAN - RC\n39,173\nAUD\n38,194\n27.02.06\nMALAWI, ZAMBIA, ZIMBABWE\nBRITISH - RC\n100,000\nGBP\n225,900\n01.12.05\nMALAWI, ZAMBIA, ZIMBABWE\nBRITISH - RC\n6,600\nGGBP\n14,956\n20.04.06\nEVALUATION\nCANADIAN - GOVT/CIDA/HAPS\n990,000\nCAD\n1,077,318\n07.11.05\nDANISH - RC\n67,394\n14.02.06\nFINNISH - RC\n100,000\nEUR\n155,700\n25.10.05\nMALAWI\nFINNISH - RC\n20,000\nEUR\n31,560\n20.04.06\nZAMBIA\nFINNISH - GOVT\n14,625\nEUR\n22,771\n25.10.05\nMALAWI\nIRISH - RC\n66,668\nEUR\n103,169\n20.12.05\nMOZAMBIQUE WATSAN\nIRISH - RC\n100,000\nEUR\n155,650\n23.01.06\nMALAWI\nJAPANESE -RC\n30,000,000\nJPY\n332,400\n02.11.05\nMONACO - RC\n20,000\nEUR\n31,140\n25.10.05\nNETHERLANDS - RC\n106,952\nEUR\n165,294\n23.11.05\nFOOD-FOR-WORK 30'000 PEOPLE \nIN MALAWI\nNORWEGIAN - GOVT/RC\n10,326,000\nNOK\n2,007,374\n15.11.05\nINCL. 2 RELIEF DELEGATES \nPRIVATE DONORS ON LINE\n567\n22.12.05\nPRIVATE DONORS ON LINE\n4,786\n26.01.06\nSWEDISH - RC\n5,000,000\nSEK\n810,000\n11.11.05\nSWEDISH - RC\n3,000,000\nSEK\n486,000\n18.11.05\nSWEDISH - GOVT\n14,250,000\nSEK\n2,315,625\n16.12.05\nSWISS - PRIVATE DONOR\n1,000\n07.11.05\nUSA - PRIVATE DONOR\n63\n13.01.06\nMALAWI\nSUB/TOTAL RECEIVED IN CASH\n9,367,861\nCHF\n23.8%\nKIND AND SERVICES (INCLUDING PERSONNEL)\nDONOR\nCATEGORY\nQUANTITY\nUNIT\nVALUE CHF\nDATE\nCOMMENT\nECHO\n585,019\n27.04.06\n443000 BAGS CSB, 147606 L.

This situation resulted in a severe food crisis and heightened malnutrition in many \nlocations of Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger. Niger was, however, the most affected country.  \n \nAs part of its overall stewardship for West Africa, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent \nSocieties regional delegation in Dakar closely monitored the situation. Through several assessment and support \nmissions to the concerned countries, the delegation assisted National Societies in disseminating warnings of \nupcoming food insecurity to affected communities as well as governments, national and international organizations.  \n \nAs the food security situation became increasingly alarming, the \nregional delegation deployed a three-member team comprising one \nconsultant and two Regional Disaster Response Team (RDRT) \nmembers to carry out a detailed assessment of the food security \nsituation in Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali and Mauritania and to assist \nthe National Societies in identifying their role in addressing the issue \nconsidering \ntheir \nexperience \nand \noperational \ncapacities. \nIn \ncoordination with the UN Office for the Coordination of \nHumanitarian Affairs (OCHA), World Food Programme (WFP), the \nUN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), other organizations \nand governments, the team developed recommendations for the \nFederation on ways of providing support to National Societies in the \nregion and possible interventions. Based on the findings of the \nassessments and information collected through secondary sources, the \nmain justifications for an emergency intervention were as follows: \nVillagers in drought-hit Tigar, Niger, gather \nfor a Red Cross food distribution. A \ncombination of drought and a locust invasion \nleft many parts of the Sahel region \ndesperately \nshort \nof \nfood. \nMark \nSnelling/British Red Cross. \n\u2022 \nLoss of life: There was increasing evidence from M\u00e9decins Sans \nFronti\u00e8res (MSF) and other sources that children were dying \u2013 \nparticularly in Niger \u2013 as a result of the crisis in the Sahel region;    \n\u2022 \nFood and health loss: Agricultural production in Niger during 2004 was severely affected by the locust invasion \nand drought.  Estimates from an assessment mission by the government, WFP, Famine Early Warning System \nNetwork (FEWS NET) and the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control (CILSS1) in March 2005 \nconcluded that 2.5 million people \u2013 approximately 20 percent of Niger\u2019s population \u2013 were food insecure and \nrequired food assistance.  The loss in cereal production was approximately 15 per cent compared to the average \nannual production over the last five years, or a grain deficit of about 225,000 metric tonnes (MT) for the year \n2005. While Mali, Burkina Faso and Mauritania were not as severely affected, they were still part of the same \ndisaster situation and needed support to discourage a further deterioration of the situation;     \n\u2022 \nLivestock loss: Livestock \u2013 particularly cattle, horses and donkeys that were least resistant to drought \u2013 were \nseverely affected by fodder shortages. Many dead carcasses were visible throughout the hardest hit parts of \nNiger and Mali.  Dakoro, Filingu\u00e9 and Ouallam were among the worst affected zones.  While no epidemics \nwere reported  (only food deficiencies and parasites) it was noted that coping capacities appeared to be stretched \nto the limit by continuing high cereal prices that translated into poor terms of trade in the selling livestock to \nbuy cereals; \n\u2022 \nEmployment loss: Because of food insecurity, many people were migrating in increasing numbers to larger \npopulation centres in search of employment or means to gain money. Population movement was considered a \nnegative indicator as it could have a detrimental impact on families, communities and security. \n \nOn 22 July 2005, the International Federation launched an Emergency Appeal seeking CHF 18,243,483 to assist \n44,400 households over a period of six months. While the Federation Emergency Appeal put forth immediate \nresponse efforts, those longer-term in nature were left for further definition pending programme support, general \nactivity progress and evolution of the crisis at hand.  After initial emergency response efforts and with the structural \nnature of the crisis in Niger and other affected countries becoming clearer, it became apparent that the initial six-\nmonth timeframe incorporating emergency, post-crisis and developmental activities was too tight. By mid-January \n2006, activities undertaken as part of the emergency appeal had reached 644,525 people (beyond the revised target \n \n1 In French: Comit\u00e9 Inter-Etate pour la Lutte contre la S\u00e9cheresse au Sahel \n \n \n2\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nof 536,000 beneficiaries), mainly due to a high response to supplementary feeding for malnourished children and \ntheir families. The appeal was subsequently revised; the number of targeted people was increased to 76,571 families \n(536,000 beneficiaries) and the timeframe was extended until end of July 2006. In line with these changes, the \nAppeal budget was increased to CHF 31,242,371 (USD 24,051,094 or EUR 19,798,714) on 13 April 2006.  \n \nAmong the various programmes of the Sahel operation, principal beneficiaries included moderately malnourished \nchildren and their families, households suffering from severe food shortages, the elderly, the ill, orphans and \ndisadvantaged pastoralist communities. Through the Red Cross/Red Crescent intervention, the assisted populations \nbenefited from sensitization and education campaigns as well as community projects such as food-for-work, \nbuilding and repair of wells, health, nutrition and hygiene training, skill enhancement and professional \ndevelopment. \n \nThis operation was effectively planned and managed, and achieved clear impact. Based on the initial success in \ndelivering the intended assistance, initiatives were undertaken to implement plans previously outlined in the appeal, \nwith a reasonable expectation that donors would support the activities and meet their obligations accordingly. \nUnfortunately, the anticipated funding support did not materialize, but the Federation had already engaged and \ncommitted with the National Societies and other partners. As a result, the operation was faced with a considerable \ndeficit (see attached final financial report). While this may raise valid questions over financial management and \ndiscipline, the Federation will resolve the situation transparently, working with the concerned National Societies. \nFor further questions related to this issue, please refer to the list of <contact details> provided at the end of this \nreport. \n \nAnalysis of the operation - objectives, achievements and impact \n \nGoal: Provide support to the affected Red Cross and Red Crescent national societies in order to decrease and \nfurther prevent vulnerability to food insecurity and malnutrition by immediately responding in the form of \nlivelihood interventions for 76,571 households (536,000 beneficiaries) over a six-month period. [As per the \nRevised Plan of Action of 7 August 2005]. \n \nSpecific objective 1 (Relief - general food distributions): Distribute a monthly general food ration to 76,571 \nhouseholds (536,000 people) in Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger.   \n \nAchievements \n \nBurkina Faso: Food distributions in the Northern provinces of Burkina Faso were completed by the end of April \n2006. However, following a field visit undertaken by the Federation, Burkinabe Red Cross Society and the \nLuxembourg Red Cross in Yatenga, Loroum and Soum provinces in December 2005, it was found that the northern \nregions still experienced severe effects of the drought as well as \nattacks by caterpillars and seed-eating birds. In some areas, food \nstocks could potentially last only two months since some producers \nwere already eating their new crop while they harvested. The \nassessment mission concluded that distributions needed to be \ncontinued in these areas, especially Oudalan, Soum, Yatenga, Loroum, \nSoum and Oudalan provinces.  \n \nConsequently, a supplementary round of distributions was done in \nSoum, Oudalan and Yatenga, reaching 19 sites and 8,984 households \nwith approximately 998 metric tonnes (MT) of foodstuffs. Rations \ncomprised of the following: 70 kg of millet, 20 kg of rice, 15 kg of \nniebe and 6 litres of vegetable oil per household in Oudalan Province; \n60 kg of millet or sorghum, 30 kg of rice, 15 kg of niebe and 6 litres of \nvegetable oil in Soum and Yatenga provinces.  \n \nMali: Mali Red Cross distributed commodities provided by the World \nFood Programme (WFP). In total, 41,413 children, aged between 5 \nand 59 months, benefited from 1.491 MT of food.  \nThe Niger Red Cross distributes essential \nfood aid to villagers in Tigar. According to \nUN statistics, some 3.6 million of Niger\u2019s 12 \nmillion inhabitants were directly affected by \nthe food crisis. Mark Snelling/British Red \nCross. \n \n \n3\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nMali Red Cross, supported directly by the Federation, provided an additional 329 MT of food. Four distribution \nrounds were planned over 120 days and took place at 104 sites among 14 communes in Timbuktu, Goundam and \nGourma-Rharous. They targeted 10,226 children, of whom 4,036 were female. Rations were composed of 250 \ngrammes of enriched flour (CSB), 30 grammes of oil and 20 grammes of sugar per child per day.  \n \nNiger: The Federation completed its two rounds of general food distribution in Tillab\u00e9ri and Agadez provinces by \nmid-October 2005, in line with the onset of the year\u2019s harvest. An estimated 143,558 beneficiaries were reached and \nover 3.327 MT of foodstuffs distributed. \n \nGiven the immense distances involved both within and between distribution areas, two logistical hubs were \nestablished for each distribution centre \u2013 one in Filingu\u00e9 and one in Agadez. A dedicated group of Red Cross \nSociety of Niger volunteers were recruited and trained for the operation (130 in Tillab\u00e9ri and 50 in Agadez). The \nRed Cross teams worked in close cooperation with village heads and local leaders in identifying and confirming \nbeneficiaries.  \n \nImpact \nThe nutritional status of vulnerable families was markedly increased. It was estimated that calorie intake had been \nraised from 90 calories per person to 1,777 calories per person, which was within the accepted norm of 2,100 \ncalories per person. \n \nConstraints \nTargeting and initial estimates of numbers of beneficiaries for general food distributions were based on government \ncensus figures. As a result, beneficiary numbers were generally underestimated and members of semi-nomadic \ncommunities were not always included. Furthermore, relief teams identified a number of \u2018gap villages\u2019 with \nequivalent needs that had not been included in lists initially received. A degree of \u2018on-the-spot diplomacy\u2019 and \nflexibility ended up being demonstrated by Federation relief teams in allocating rations and adjusting second round \ndistributions in order to meet the needs of additional people vulnerable throughout a number of communities. \n \nThe distances and remote nature of many villages created logistical challenges and an increased workload for relief \ndistributions \u2013 in one case mules were used as a local means of transportation for general food distributions.  In \nBurkina Faso, the greatest constraints were distances between the capital, Ouagadougou, and main areas of \noperation, posing a challenge in purchasing, transport and general programme implementation. Distributions in \nareas such as Soum were complicated by the existence of large areas of swampy land following the rainy season, \nmaking access highly difficult. To counter the problem, distribution points were established in the nearest dry areas. \nAlthough new distribution points posed greater travelling distances for beneficiaries, they remained accessible by \ncart enabling the local population to still receive much needed food assistance in a fairly timely manner.   \n \nIn Mali, transport was challenging as some villages were not reachable by road; \u2018pinasses\u2019 or motorized pirogues \nwere, therefore, rented. Unfortunately, pinasses could not ensure totally secure transportation since some goods \ncould become wet and unusable and others could be lost overboard. Furthermore, the duration of distributions in \nMali was prolonged due to difficulties in the identification of children as many bear similar names.  In addition, due \nto migration habits, organizing distributions for nomadic populations was generally a challenge.  \n \nSpecific objective 2: (Health \u2013 supplementary feeding): Provide basic health services through emergency \nsupplementary feeding for targeted vulnerable children aged under five years, to a total population of 24,500 \nin Niger. \n \nAchievements \nRed Cross/Red Crescent supplementary feeding programmes were operational in Niger since 1 August 2005 in \ncooperation with the French Red Cross (who already had an established bilateral programme in Niger), the Qatari \nRed Crescent and the Spanish Red Cross in the regions of Tahoua, Maradi, Zinder, Tanout and Agadez. By the \nclose of September 2005, the government of Niger had a new protocol in place, establishing its responsibility for the \nnutritional situation in the country. By that time, the Federation was questioning the merits of a \u2018parallel system\u2019 of \na supplementary feeding being conducted by the international humanitarian community as a long-term venture. It \nbecame clear that the Federation, in partnership with the Red Cross Society of Niger needed to assist government \nregional authorities in making their health centre personnel more tangibly responsible for the management of \nmalnutrition. \n \n \n4\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nBy mid-January 2006, 48,525 moderately malnourished children had been treated through the Red Cross/Red \nCrescent supplementary feeding centres at Tahoua, Maradi, Zinder, Agadez-Arlit and Tanout. An additional 3,825 \nmoderately malnourished children were treated between February and September 2006. In addition to the treatment \nrations for malnourished children (UNIMIX), their families received protection rations, bringing the total number of \nbeneficiaries to 291,150. The protection rations were composed of 100 kg of cereals, 50 kg of beans and four litres \nof vegetable oil per month. This ration was halved after the harvest (end of October 2005), and was discontinued \ncompletely in December 2005.   \n \nConstraints  \nThe caseload of supplementary feeding centres was higher than \nexpected, putting additional strain and workload on Red Cross \nvolunteers \nand \ndelegates. \nThe \noverwhelming \nresponse \nto \nsupplementary feeding and the provision of family protection rations \n\u2013 the combination of a health programme and relief activity \u2013 posed \nchallenges for ensuring quality programming, adequate training and \nservice provision, general staff supervision and management.  \nNiger Red Cross Society volunteers weighing \na little child. According to the Niger Red \nCross, many children were moderately or \nseverely \nmalnourished \nin \nNiger. \nOlav \nSaltbones/Norwegian Red Cross. \n \nAnother main challenge for the supplementary feeding treatment \nprogramme was the prevalence of malaria and other endemic diseases \nin Niger. As a result, the health programme of the Qatari Red \nCrescent involved additional training and treatment for malaria as \npart of its supplementary feeding activities. Vaccination programmes \nwere also implemented at a number of the feeding centres. \n \nThe protection ratios that were being provided to families with \nmalnourished children were ultimately discontinued due to the \nfollowing reasons:  \n\u2022 \nAnecdotal evidence indicated that children were been kept \ndeliberately malnourished so that their families could receive \nthe rations;  \n\u2022 \nObservations by staff and volunteers showed that some \nmothers took their children to the health centres only when \nthere were distributions of family rations;  \n\u2022 \nSome women gave their children purgative plants to keep \nthem thin, thus eligible for the programme. \n \nSpecific objective 3 (relief \u2013 cash distribution): As per the Revised Plan of Action of 7 August 2005, a cash \ndistribution was foreseen targeting 20,000 beneficiaries, or 4,000 households, to communities in Niger and \nMali. \n \nAchievements \nAs of 18 November 2005, cash distributions were completed at Tanout assisting 34,278 beneficiaries (5,713 \nhouseholds) in 88 villages and three pastoralist settlements. One-time cash grants of XOF 120,000 (approximately \nUSD 240 or EUR 182), were provided to each household.  \n \nAs part of the cash project \u2013 and through a unique partnership between the Federation, British Red Cross, Swedish \nRed Cross and University of Arizona \u2013 a monitoring regime began in the aftermath of the distributions to assess \ntheir impact at household, village, market and regional levels. Quantitative and qualitative information gathering \nalso focused on the impact of cash distributions on the nutritional status of recipient and non-recipient households. \nThe report of the evaluation is available upon request.  \n \nIn summary (according to the Phase III evaluation report), households that received financial support from the Red \nCross/Red Crescent were less likely to be indebted (4.9 per cent compared to 25.3 per cent). Among indebted \nhouseholds, cash recipients were lesser in debt compared to those who did not receive cash (average amount to be \nrepaid XOF 24,514 for cash villages and XOF 64,625 for control villages). These findings support reports from \n \n \n5\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nPhase I and II evaluations, which indicated that households used financial resources from the Red Cross cash \ndistribution to pay off loans and reduce indebtedness. The reports are available upon request. \n \nImpact \nAssistance was provided to 5,713 vulnerable families at a critical juncture in the yearly cycle, by providing them \nwith the means to manage their immediate economic needs and reestablish their households on a more secure \nfinancial footing.  \n \nConstraints \nOpposition to cash distribution by some non-governmental and international organizations, coupled with unclear \nsupport from the authorities, led to a degree of confusion that came close to derailing the project. A last-minute \nmessage received from the Governor of Zinder, conveyed through the Head of the CCA (who is responsible to the \nCabinet and Office of the Prime Minister), temporarily suspended cash distributions just prior to the scheduled start \nof the project. Following extensive negotiations, a formal agreement with the government was reached, sanctioned \nby the President of Niger, with full support from the Red Cross Society of Niger. \n \nLack of banking facilities in Tanout and surrounding remote villages led to some logistical and security challenges. \nHowever, these were successfully addressed and the project progressed well. \n \nSpecific objective 4 (Logistics, administration and telecoms): Immediately augment the existing Red Cross \nand Red Crescent National Societies with logistical, administrative and telecommunications infrastructure in \nthe four different countries of the Sahel operation. \n \nAchievements \n \nIT/Telecoms: The Mali Red Cross benefited from the presence of an IT/Telecoms delegate during the first six \nmonths of the Sahel operation when the main installations were done. The Sahel operation IT/Telecoms team \ninstalled a wide area network/local area network (WAN/LAN) with an access point and Internet connection for \napproximately 15 users. A counterpart from the National Society was recruited and trained; before leaving Mali, the \nSahel operation IT/Telecom team handed over to the IT/telecom counterpart who would ensure proper maintenance \nof the equipment, with support from the team in Niamey. A total of five laptops and three radios were provided by \nthe British Red Cross and two new desktops, one network printer and radios by the Federation.  \n \nIn Mauritania, the Federation installed three high frequency (HF) and very high frequency (VHF) bases in Zoucrete, \nNouakchott and Nema/Nouadibhou, and two mobile HF and VHF units (with 15 handsets), in response to \npopulation movements.   \n \nIn Burkina Faso, the British Red Cross provided the Burkinabe Faso \nRed Cross Society with four laptops, two Thuraya satellite phones as \nwell as HF and VHF equipment in two vehicles.  \n \nIn addition to IT/telecom bases that already existed in Niger, the \nFederation provided the Red Cross Society of Niger with one laptop, \ntwo desktops, one network printer, two HF and VHF bases for Niamey \nand Tahoua as well as two HF and VHF mobiles and 15 handsets. An \nIT/telecom counterpart was recruited and trained, and an Internet \nconnection was provided. \n \nLogistics: Overall, logistics of the operation functioned well, despite \nsome under-staffing and staff change challenges. The fleet in Niger \nran at full capacity, with 31 Federation vehicles and 11 rental vehicles \ncovering over 200,000 km a month, often over difficult terrain. The \noperation in Mali was also a logistical success, as commodities were delivered to a much dispersed set of \nbeneficiaries, also over very challenging terrains.   \nInternational Federation officials preparing \nTSU trucks for food distributions in Niger. \nOlav Saltbones/Norwegian Red Cross. \n \n \n \n6\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \n                                                \nFor the distributions that were undertaken in Burkina Faso, 333.5 MT of rice, sorghum and oil were transported \nfrom the Red Cross Society of Niger/Federation/Transport Support Unit (TSU) warehouse in Niamey to the various \ndistribution sites. Two Federation logisticians were dispatched from Niger to support the relief delegate and the \nBurkinabe Red Cross Society to complete the distributions and to assess the National Society\u2019s capacities.  \n \nIn Filingue-Abala (Niger), as part of food-for-work activities, a sub-office and warehouse were temporarily \nestablished at Abala.  Ten Transport Support Unit trucks were dispatched as part of the food-for-work effort, and a \nstock of 200 MT of cereals was put in place. TSU operational hubs were based in Tahoua and Maradi, with \napproximately 20 trucks in each location and 30 trucks remaining in Niamey.  \n \nLogistics training in Niamey was completed, with similar training (for about 10 people per session for 3 days) \nundertaken in Zinder, Agadez, Tillabery, Tahoua and Maradi. The warehouse and compound of the Red Cross \nSociety of Niger were also renovated to include a new entry zone, an improved grading to protect the area against \nground water and rains as well as new roofing. \n \nApart from supporting the Federation and other Red Cross/Red Crescent activities, the TSU supported WFP \ncooperating partners such as Action Against Hunger (ACF 2), Concern and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) \nthrough \u2018cluster deployments\u2019 of up to ten trucks.  \n \nImpact \nThe logistics team supported Federation operations and Partner National Society programmes, concentrating its \nactivities on the general food distributions and supplementary feeding programmes. Though the enormous distances \nthat had to be covered (compounded by an often unreliable supply chain) posed some challenges, beneficiary needs \nwere met in a timely and regular manner. \n \nConstraints \nIn Burkina Faso, internal and external communications were hampered by a lack of equipment, difficult and \nunreliable connections and a lack of available technical personnel to pursue implementation of IT/telecoms activities. \n \nThe long distances involved in transporting goods across the region, the quality of the transport infrastructure and \nweather conditions at certain times, compounded by an unreliable supply chain, posed challenges for operational \nlogistics. Despite the constraints, the Federation possessed a dynamic logistics team able to overcome obstacles so \nthat beneficiary demands could be met in a timely and regular manner.   \n \nAmong logistical challenges, one difficulty was the imposition by the Government of Niger on limits of tonnage for \ntrucks passing through Niamey. Shipments for a number of organizations, most notably the Federation, WFP and \nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), were blocked in transit due to the new regulations which levied fines of \nXOF 10,000 per metric tonne on cargo exceeding 25 metric tonnes. In response, the Federation sought and received \na temporary exemption for its food commodities that were already en route. \n \nThe receipt of food commodities was a complicated process since limited information tended to be provided by \nfreight forwarders regarding expected delivery times. Discussions with freight forwarders on behalf of Sahel \nOperation staff improved the situation, resulting in the ultimate receipt of all goods.  \n \nSpecific objective 5 (Relief - livestock interventions for Mali and Niger): As per the Revised Plan of Action of \n7 August 2005, it was anticipated that 5,000 pastoralists would be assisted in Mali and Niger.   \n \nAchievements  \nThe food distributions also provided the opportunity to undertake parallel activities in the area of livestock health \nand support. On 11 November 2005, livestock vaccination sensitization campaigns started in different villages in the \nSalam Region, in cooperation with the Malian Ministry of Livestock. Radio stations broadcasted campaign \ninformation in four local languages and heads of villages were contacted as part of the sensitization process.   \n \n \n2 In French: Action Contre la Faim \n \n \n7\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \n                                                \nIn turn, 15,897 heads of livestock were vaccinated in Salam and Gourma Rharous. The number of cattle attended to \nwas well above the original target of 10,000, despite reticence amongst pastoralists in identifying exact numbers of \ncattle due to taxation implications.  \n \nIn December 2005 and January 2006, two rounds of fodder distributions were undertaken in the Salam Region. \nTheir purpose was to ensure livestock fodder consumption, prevent livestock sales on the markets and guarantee \nfodder in cold periods. There were two main breeder selection criteria; at least one malnourished child in the \nhousehold and breeders had to own between 10 and 50 livestock heads. Roughly 10,400 livestock heads benefited \nfrom fodder distributions totalling 180 MT. \n \nImpact \nReinforcing vulnerable livestock, thereby enabling on-going viability of pastoralist communities through a livestock \nvaccination programme and the distribution of fodder, enabled them to build up their livestock capacity so as to \nsurvive the extreme temperatures period that begins in December. \n \nSpecific objective 6 (Relief - cereal bank support for Mali and Niger): As per the Revised Plan of Action of 7 \nAugust 2005, it was anticipated that food stocks could be placed at cereal banks in 250 of the worst affected \ncommunities in Mali and Niger. \n \nAchievements \nAs monitoring progressed, it became evident that cereal banks could be a means of further assisting people affected \nby drought in Niger. Preliminary investigations suggested that as many as 50 villages could benefit from cereal \nbanks as a means of enhancing their longer-term food security.   \n \nA project manager from the British Red Cross arrived in Niger to develop a pilot cereal bank project, along with \nacademic staff from the University of Arizona. In addition to the funding provided by the British Red Cross, the \nFederation agreed to provide logistics support for the research and implementation phases of the pilot project.  \n \nVillage lands were identified, sites were confirmed using the Global Positioning System (GPS) and official \ndocuments were signed by village chiefs who authorized allocation of the land. A total of 21 cereal banks were \nconstructed in villages around Tanout; construction was completed in July, 2006, before the onset of the rainy \nseason. The banks were built using cement bricks, concrete and steel. The rationale for using these materials to \nbuild the cereal banks, instead of local traditional materials, was based on research done (reflecting on the use of \nboth types of products) with an important factor being the reduction of overhead costs, thus contributing to longer-\nterm sustainability. \n \nTwenty one village committees for cereal bank management were created and a three-day management training was \nconducted. Several items, including tables, chairs, notebooks, pens and cleaning products for the cereal banks, were \nprovided. Since the cereal banks began operating during the lean season, rice sales started immediately after \nconstruction was completed and management committees were in place.   \n \nAccording to the original design, households were required to pay a XOF 500 membership fee in order to purchase \ncereals3 from the banks. In Farak, 200 households were active in the cereal banks, with each household eligible to \npurchase up to five tias per week.  Funds collected from the sales were to be kept until after the harvest, when prices \ndropped significantly and more cereals could be purchased for use in the next lean season. \n \nConstraints \nDue to the requirement to pay membership fees, it was found out that 30 per cent of households were not accessing \nfood in the banks by July 2006. Management committees were primarily comprised of men, and it was not possible \nto ascertain whether the most vulnerable households were represented in the committees. Given that literacy and \nnumeracy skills were some of the criteria used to select members of the committee, it is likely that the most \nvulnerable households were not represented. In Farak, CARE had been working for two years, providing support to \n \n3 During a post-operation evaluation of the project, a meeting with women in Farak village revealed that they were paying XOF \n850 per tia of rice in the banks, compared to XOF 1,100 in the market.    \n \n \n8\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \n                                                \nwomen\u2019s village banks. The skills gained by the women in managing cereal banks could have been capitalized upon \nin setting up the management committee for the Red Cross-supported cereal banks. Women, who had proven their \nability to manage the savings of village banks and had gained the trust of their members, could have formed the \nmanagement committees. The Red Cross has realized this and in future, such interventions shall take into \nconsideration available skills and gender balance. \n \nSpecific objective 7 (Health \u2013 post-emergency health for Niger): Sustainable health interventions to promote \nresilience and improve the longer-term health of the most vulnerable are advocated.   \n \nAchievements \n \nMalnutrition strategy \nAs part of the technical support-transition process for the integrated health centres (CSI)4, and on behalf of the \nFederation and the Red Cross Society of Niger, 60 health officers and 30 general staff were trained in malnutrition \nscreening and treatment (according to the national protocol), and supplementary feeding stock management. The \ntraining and integration of services was undertaken in 15 health centres, including Hadachimo, Mogheur, Dangona, \nMaboya, Ill\u00e9la, Bagaroua, S\u00e9hia, T\u00e9baram, Toulou, Edir, Dandoutchi, Taja\u00e9, Dandaji and Moull\u00e9la. As part of the \nintegration strategy, the Federation trained 40 Red Cross Society of Niger volunteers who will continue providing \ntechnical support to community health centres.  \n \nBecause chronic malnutrition is a result of specific behaviours towards food and hygiene, the main focus of the \nSahel operation health team at Tahoua was educating key people (matrons within communities and Red Cross \nSociety of Niger volunteers) as agents who would sensitize and mobilize the local populations. To this end, 60 \nmatrons and 40 Red Cross Society of Niger volunteers working with the CSI in Tahoua and Ill\u00e9la districts were \ntrained in nutrition information, education and communication (IEC).  \n \nMatrons were considered key people as they are usually the traditional advisers of mothers on children\u2019s health \nissues within communities. Training sessions for matrons typically lasted two days while for volunteers took one \nday. A training of trainers (ToT) session for Red Cross Society of Niger counterparts in nutrition and education was \nalso undertaken through the health programme in Tahoua. In addition, 150 training sessions on nutrition followed in \nJuly 2006.  \n \nMobile health \nFollowing a pilot mobile health team project initiated in October 2005 in the Tahoua area, a Memorandum of \nUnderstanding was entered into with the regional health authorities for on-going delivery of much needed basic \nhealth care to remote communities that lacked access to basic health services.  \n \nIn November 2005, three mobile clinics were set up in Tahoua, with five trained volunteers in each. They visited 48 \ndifferent sites (120 villages in three different health districts), often together with the major (nurse) from the nearest \nhealth centre. During the visits, they vaccinated children aged under five years, made prenatal and post natal \nconsultations, sensitized women on basic health issues, conducted malnutrition screening, and provided de-worming \nmedication.  \n \nBetween March and August 2006, 9,888 children had been vaccinated and 1,906 de-wormed. The vaccination \ncoverage in the region where the clinics were operating was more than 90 per cent. 2,674 prenatal consultations \nwere held where women were vaccinated, and 3,731 malnourished children were identified and sent to malnutrition \ncentres. About 8,196 women were reached with messages/information on breastfeeding issues, weaning, diarrhoea, \nvaccination of new-borns, malaria, use of mosquito nets, food-environmental-and body hygiene, and family \nplanning. \n \nImpact \nThe mobile health teams contributed to the improvement of access to primary health in the Tahoua region. Due to \nimproved access, the vaccination coverage amongst children under 11 months was increased in the region and in \nother areas of operation under the supplementary feeding programmes. \n \n \n4 In French: Centre de Sant\u00e9 Int\u00e9gr\u00e9 (CSI) \n \n \n9\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nConstraint \nDistances to these remote villages were great, sometimes between 150 and 230 km, and road access was non-\nexistent.  \n \nSpecific objective 8: Water and sanitation (WatSan), Niger \n \nAchievements \nFollowing an assessment mission undertaken in September 2005, a number of potential water and sanitation \nactivities were outlined that were to be implemented immediately or over the mid-term and longer-term. Among the \nactivities were the following: construction and rehabilitation of well; construction and rehabilitation of school \nlatrines; and construction and rehabilitation of family latrines. With assistance from the Swedish Red Cross, \nimplementation of WatSan activities began. The programme was later scaled up with financial support from the \nQatari Red Crescent and it is being implemented after the close of the Sahel operation.  \n \nEighty volunteers from the Red Cross Society of Niger were trained in Participatory Hygiene and Sanitation \nTransformation (PHAST), a methodology that builds on people\u2019s innate ability to address and resolve their own \nproblems. In turn, the Red Cross volunteers trained community-based volunteers in the targeted villages; the Red \nCross volunteers were equipped with motorbikes to facilitate easy reach (five villages per volunteer). More than 70 \nof these volunteers conducted sensitization activities in 235 villages of Tahoua, Tillabery and Zinder. In Tahoua and \nin Filingu\u00e9, 110 water management committees have been formed and their members trained. The committees are \nnow responsible for managing the wells constructed/rehabilitated under the project. Similar committees will be \nestablished in Zinder. The WatSan activities will continue until end of July 2007. \n \nImpact \nHygiene promotion, using the PHAST methodology, in Tahoua contributed towards cholera prevention \u2013 in 2006 \u2013 \nin areas where cholera is endemic, such as in Bouza.   \n \nConstraints \nAt the beginning, implementation of activities was slow because there were no community-based volunteers in the \ntargeted villages. Due to delays in implementation, water and sanitation activities should continue for two years to \nassure the ownership of the infrastructure by the beneficiaries. \n \nSpecific objective 9: Logistics \u2013 capacity building  \n \nAchievements \nDifferent trainings were provided to the Red Cross Society of Niger volunteers and staff. The sessions include a \ntraining that was held in Niamey for 15 members of the governance and executive branches of the National Society. \nThe five-day workshop covered issues such as project planning, logistics, preparedness and response, procurement, \nwarehousing and transport management as well as IT/telecommunications. During the last day of training, a visit to \nthe National Society\u2019s warehouse and a brainstorming session were undertaken about the future of logistics within \nthe Red Cross Society of Niger. Three days of training were also held for volunteers and staff members in Zinder, \nAgadez, Tillabery, Tahoua and Maradi.  \n \nAn emergency stock of 1,000 MT of cereals was pre-positioned for the Red Cross Society of Niger at its Niamey \nwarehouse. The emergency stock was treated as per Federation standards, with National Society staff members \ntrained in warehousing techniques. In the framework of the general logistics training, a specific module on \nwarehousing was provided. At the Red Cross Society of Niger Tahoua base, a logistics counterpart was fully \nintegrated into Federation activities.   \n \nSpecific objective 10: Relief-livelihoods capacity building in Niger. \n \nAchievements \n \nLivelihoods small grants programme \nThe small grants project was implemented by the Irish Red Cross in Agadez and divided into two parts; family \ngrants and collective grants for micro-projects. Family grants were meant to assist vulnerable families until the next \nrainy season and reinforce their coping mechanisms in future by contributing to replenishment of their household \n \n \n10\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \neconomy. Collective grants for micro-projects were oriented towards reinforcement of food security of local \ncommunities.  \n \nAfter a series of surveys and assessments, the Irish Red Cross, as the manager of the activity, decided to provide \ngrants to ten per cent of the vulnerable populations in each village (people aged over 60 years, and \npregnant/lactating women). Focus groups, with women, revealed that small animals were considered the highest \npriority to improve livelihood security; some women identified food as their greatest need while others indicated the \nneed for alternative sources of income, such as weaving palm frond for sale in the local market.  \nAccordingly, the Red Cross implemented a programme where staff, with support from branch volunteers, purchased \nsmall ruminants (sheep and goats) in bulk for distribution to targeted households. Beneficiaries participated in \nassessing the general health of the animals before they were purchased. Cereals were also purchased in bulk and \ngiven to extremely vulnerable households, based on family size. Finally, palm fronds were provided directly to \nwomen to make mats, and the Red Cross volunteers assisted in marketing.  This programme ended in August 2006. \n \nFood-for-work projects: In Mali, in addition to relief food distributions, \u2018food for work\u2019 and \u2018food-for-training\u2019 \nprogrammes were implemented up to end of November 2005. \u2018Food-for-work\u2019 and \u2018food-for-training\u2019 distributions \nwere made at the beginning and the end of the work/training sessions, and they aimed at protecting the child rations \nalready distributed. Among the food-for-work projects were dyke construction, reforestation, water pipe \nconstruction, irrigation, warehouse construction and market gardening.  \n \nFood-for-training projects were mainly oriented towards HIV/AIDS sensitization, elimination of illiteracy and \nnutrition education. Beneficiaries received 2 kg of cereals and 75 grammes of oil per day when participating in a \nfood-for-work project and 1.2 kg of cereals and 45 grammes of oil per day when participating in a training session. \n \nIn Niger, following an initial assessment and discussions with community members on the most important needs at \nthe community level, food-for-work projects were designed and implemented in Agadez, in Filingue-Abala, and in \nTahoua.   \n \nA pilot project was undertaken in Fadama and Tillimoune, two villages north of Abala and close to the Mali border. \nActivities in both villages focused on provision of water and agriculture. They included: \n\u2022 \nSoil recuperation and improvement of a water catchment in Fadama and Tillimoune; \n\u2022 \nRehabilitation of a community well in Fadama and Tillimoune. \n \nBy July 2006, 1,113 workers had benefited from the food-for-work projects in Tillimoune and Fadama. In \nTillimoune, the projects included well rehabilitation and soil rehabilitation (through construction of half moons), \nconstruction of stone walls and planting trees. Rehabilitation of wells was completed, and 2,630 forest half moons, \n5,008 agricultural half-moons and 4.16 km of stone lines were installed. More than 6,000 trees were planted. In \nFadama, in addition to soil rehabilitation, there were three additional projects; one to deepen a pond (to make it a \nyear-round catchment area), the second to build four micro-dams (to slow down water flow so that water would \nfilter down to the water table), and the third to rehabilitate a deep well. All projects were identified by communities. \nWell reconstruction and the four micro-dams were completed.  \n \nIn Tahoua, four food-for-work projects were conducted to recuperate 80 hectares of land through the construction of \nhalf-moons and planting acacia trees. A total of 23,710 half-moons were dug, and 5,200 acacia trees were planted.  \nA rotation system for teams of workers was established so that each team would work for one day out of three, \nleaving the other two days available for working in their fields. At least 719 persons, including 77 branch volunteers \nand 10 technical specialists, worked in the projects and received sufficient food to meet their family needs for one \nmonth.    \n \nImpact \nThe assistance provided to 5,713 vulnerable families at a critical juncture in the yearly cycle, helped them with the \nmeans to manage their immediate economic needs and re-establish their households on a more secure financial \nfooting.  \n \n \n \n11\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nThe relatively substantial cash grant provided vulnerable households with a choice in coping mechanisms. \nEvaluation reports indicate that families that benefited from small grants used the funds to buy foodstuffs, cattle and \nnecessary household implements, such as carts, and to pay off debts. This showed that households prioritized \ninvesting in their longer-term economic viability over shorter-term needs. \n \nHouseholds were not constrained to pay off debts by selling their harvest at a loss. Cash-in-hand enabled agro-\npastoralist communities to decide when to buy and when to sell, thereby ensuring better management of their \nharvest and livestock. It also enabled stockpiling of millet, to help families apportion their harvest to last them \nthrough the lean period, which soon followed.  \n \nConstraints \nUnfortunately, one of the dams constructed in Fadama did not hold, and there was insufficient time remaining in the \nproject to rehabilitate the dam. In addition, trees were not planted as expected and the Red Cross eventually gave \n2,000 of the trees to the Department of the Environment for planting elsewhere. \n \nSpecific objective 11 (Reporting-media-communications \u2013 advocacy and public information): Promote and \ndisseminate within the target audience the activities highlighted in the Supplementary Plan of Action \u2013 \nAppeal Extension and overall Sahel operation.    \n \nAchievements  \nThroughout the operation, the Federation information delegate held regular interviews with international, local and \nregional media. The delegate also accompanied camera teams to the field, and briefed journalists interested in the \nrelief operation as well as communication teams of Partner National Societies. In addition, key documents, \nphotographs and fact sheets were developed and shared with partners, stakeholders and national societies interested \nand/or involved in the operation. Articles were published on the Federation\u2019s website and a dedicated section \nfocusing on the Sahel food crisis was created.  \n \nContinuous training was provided to the Federation regional information officer, in Dakar, on the professional role \nforeseen within the Federation, focusing on information-gathering during disasters and reporting. This aimed at \nensuring continuity of highlighting forgotten disasters once the operation closed. In addition, documents on \ninformation management during disasters \u2013 produced by the Inter-Americas Communicators Network \u2013 were shared \nwith the Red Cross Society of Niger press officer.  \n \nTraining packages on promotion of Humanitarian Values and Red Cross principles, including information on the \nCode of Conduct of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief, were given to \nFederation staff and Partner National Societies working in the Sahel operation (in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger). \nThe aim was to reinforce knowledge of Red Cross principles and values among the volunteers involved in the food-\ncrisis operation, especially newcomers. \n \nCoordination \n \nWithin the Red Cross/Red Crescent Movement \nCoordination and cooperation within logistics, human resources and programme support was established between \nthe Federation and Participating National Societies, in particular the French Red Cross, the Irish Red Cross, the \nQatari Red Crescent, the Saudi Arabian Red Crescent and the Spanish Red Cross. As the Sahel operation developed, \ncontact was also established with the Iranian Red Crescent as it has a long-standing and noteworthy presence in \nNiger.  \n \nThe Federation regional delegation in Dakar facilitated and coordinated the deployment of Regional Disaster \nResponse Team (RDRT) members from West Africa. Staff provided by the National Societies of Algeria, Benin, \nCameroon, Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Nigeria and Togo played a crucial role since the \nearliest stages of the operation. Their involvement was pivotal for the development, implementation and success of \nvarious activities. It signalled the reliable expertise available throughout different countries in the region.   \n \nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) provided regular security updates. ICRC also provided \ntraining for volunteers from the Red Cross Society of Niger, in Tahoua.  \n \n \n12\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nWith beneficiaries \nAt the local and regional-country level, relief and supplementary feeding activities were undertaken in collaboration \nwith local and provincial authorities to facilitate coordination while underlining and ensuring respect for \nFundamental Principles of the Red Cross Movement. Heads of villages were, in particular, closely linked to the Red \nCross/Red Crescent response due to their pivotal role within communities.   \n \nWith government agencies \nAn effective working relationship was established with the main governmental bodies involved in the crisis \u2013 such \nas Cellule de Crise Alimentaire (CCA) and Syst\u00e8me d\u2019Alerte Pr\u00e9coce (SAP) \u2013 and with key government of Niger \nministries, in cooperation with the Red Cross Society of Niger. The ministries included the Ministry of Health and \nthe Ministry of Community Development.  In Tahoua (Niger), the Red Cross/Red Crescent worked very closely \nwith regional government health staff. This facilitated competency development and the eventual transfer of \nsupplementary feeding centres to the government.    \n \nWith other agencies \nSince the onset of the Sahel operation, the Federation collaborated closely with United Nations agencies \n(particularly in the organization of transport services and provision of food assistance), and the broader \nhumanitarian community, most notably in the health sector.   \n \nThe operation had a series of partnerships, which enabled the Red Cross/Red Crescent to draw on other forms of \nexpertise, as well as additional financial resources to support the activities. Collegial support for various Federation \nactivities was received from organizations such as Concern, GOAL, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), Oxfam and \nSave the Children-UK.   \n \nThrough the Transport Support Unit (TSU), the Federation developed relationships with WFP and its implementing \npartners. Greater numbers of beneficiaries were assisted on a timely basis through food distribution and food-for-\nwork than would have been possible had the TSU not been established.   \n \nThe Spanish Red Cross in Maradi had an agreement with MSF-France, where severely malnourished children \nwould be referred to MSF for treatment, and moderately malnourished children seeking assistance at MSF clinics \nwould be referred to Red Cross clinics for treatment.   \n \nThe British Red Cross contracted the services of the University of Arizona to monitor the impact of the cash \ndistribution project in Tanout. This had the effect of bringing in highly qualified experts who provided objectivity in \nmonitoring data and impact. \n \nConcern referred children (when they have reached 80 per cent of their weight) from its acute malnutrition feed \ncentres to the Red Cross/Red Crescent. Concern invested considerable time to ensure that its supplementary feeding \nactivities did not overlap those of the Red Cross.   \n \nNational Society Capacity Building \nIn general, all sectors of the intervention contained elements for training and support of volunteers and staff of Host \nNational Societies. Among the various aspects of the Sahel operation, a network of more than 360 volunteers was \ntrained as part of the initial emergency response in the areas of relief, health care, logistics, administration, \ntelecommunications, reporting and media relations. In a relatively short time, their knowledge of the Red Cross/Red \nCrescent Movement was greatly enhanced. As key players in an operational partnership, volunteers and staff \nconsistently showed their dedication and skills.     \n \nThe counterpart system was very successful, especially in supplementary feeding centres, mobile health clinics, \ncommunity health, water and sanitation, and food-for-work. In all these sectors, activities were implemented using \ncounterparts from local Red Cross branches.   \n \nTraining of Burkinabe Red Cross Society volunteers in registration and distribution procedures was undertaken in \nconjunction with its first aid section. In each province of Burkina Faso, a team of 30 volunteers supported by a \nsupervisor, team leader and logistician was established. Volunteers were then deployed to the various target areas or \n\u2018d\u00e9partements\u2019 within the province and the supervisor/team leader continued to work alongside the volunteers. \n \n \n13\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nWith support from the operation, the Tahoua branch of the Red Cross Society of Niger rehabilitated its offices, \nincreased its professional competency and strengthened its financial management capability. A number of \nvolunteers were trained and they in turn provided support to local health centres and other key community health \nactivities. The branch also developed its logistics capacity to provide necessary support, when needed, in Tahoua. \n \nMonitoring and evaluation \nWith a variety of Movement actors continuing their presence in Niger following the closure of the operation, a \nfocused evaluation was commissioned by the Federation to review efforts undertaken under the Sahel Operation. \nThe evaluation particularly emphasized on Niger (which was the most affected country, and where the operation \nreally focused on), to help determine how the remaining actors can capitalize on their presence, interests and \nstrengths in reflection of continuing needs in the country.  \n \nThe evaluation focused on three thematic areas: appropriateness of the disaster response intervention; processes; \nand relationships. The findings indicate that through the Sahel operation, the Red Cross/Red Crescent contributed to \nthe reduction of the short-term effects of the drought. The Red Cross/Red Crescent intervention helped to reduce \nfood insecurity and addressed the needs of moderately malnourished children, among others. \n \nFor further information specifically related to this operation please contact: \n\u2022 \nIn Dakar: Alasan Senghore, Federation Head of Zone for West and Central Africa, Dakar; email: \nalasan.senghore@ifrc.org; telephone +221.869.36.41; fax +221.860.20.02. \n \nAll International Federation assistance seeks to adhere to the Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and \nRed Crescent Movement and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO's) in Disaster Relief and is committed to the \nHumanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards in Disaster Response (Sphere) in delivering assistance to the most \nvulnerable. \n \nFor longer-term programmes in this or other countries or regions, please refer to the Federation\u2019s Annual Appeal. \nFor support to or for further information concerning Federation programmes or operations in this or other \ncountries, or for national society profiles, please also access the Federation\u2019s website at http://www.ifrc.org\n \n \n<Final financial report below; click here to return to the title page> \n \n \n14\nSelected Parameters\nReporting Timeframe\n2005/4-2007/8\nBudget Timeframe\n2005/4-2007/8\nAppeal\nM05EA015\nBudget\nAPPEAL\nAll figures are in Swiss Francs (CHF)\nFinal Financial Report\nM05EA015 - BURKINA FASO, MALI, MAURITANIA & NIGER: FOOD INSEC\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies\nI.

This situation resulted in a severe food crisis and heightened malnutrition in many \nlocations of Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger. Niger was, however, the most affected country.  \n \nAs part of its overall stewardship for West Africa, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent \nSocieties regional delegation in Dakar closely monitored the situation. Through several assessment and support \nmissions to the concerned countries, the delegation assisted National Societies in disseminating warnings of \nupcoming food insecurity to affected communities as well as governments, national and international organizations.  \n \nAs the food security situation became increasingly alarming, the \nregional delegation deployed a three-member team comprising one \nconsultant and two Regional Disaster Response Team (RDRT) \nmembers to carry out a detailed assessment of the food security \nsituation in Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali and Mauritania and to assist \nthe National Societies in identifying their role in addressing the issue \nconsidering \ntheir \nexperience \nand \noperational \ncapacities. \nIn \ncoordination with the UN Office for the Coordination of \nHumanitarian Affairs (OCHA), World Food Programme (WFP), the \nUN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), other organizations \nand governments, the team developed recommendations for the \nFederation on ways of providing support to National Societies in the \nregion and possible interventions. Based on the findings of the \nassessments and information collected through secondary sources, the \nmain justifications for an emergency intervention were as follows: \nVillagers in drought-hit Tigar, Niger, gather \nfor a Red Cross food distribution. A \ncombination of drought and a locust invasion \nleft many parts of the Sahel region \ndesperately \nshort \nof \nfood. \nMark \nSnelling/British Red Cross. \n\u2022 \nLoss of life: There was increasing evidence from M\u00e9decins Sans \nFronti\u00e8res (MSF) and other sources that children were dying \u2013 \nparticularly in Niger \u2013 as a result of the crisis in the Sahel region;    \n\u2022 \nFood and health loss: Agricultural production in Niger during 2004 was severely affected by the locust invasion \nand drought.  Estimates from an assessment mission by the government, WFP, Famine Early Warning System \nNetwork (FEWS NET) and the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control (CILSS1) in March 2005 \nconcluded that 2.5 million people \u2013 approximately 20 percent of Niger\u2019s population \u2013 were food insecure and \nrequired food assistance.  The loss in cereal production was approximately 15 per cent compared to the average \nannual production over the last five years, or a grain deficit of about 225,000 metric tonnes (MT) for the year \n2005. While Mali, Burkina Faso and Mauritania were not as severely affected, they were still part of the same \ndisaster situation and needed support to discourage a further deterioration of the situation;     \n\u2022 \nLivestock loss: Livestock \u2013 particularly cattle, horses and donkeys that were least resistant to drought \u2013 were \nseverely affected by fodder shortages. Many dead carcasses were visible throughout the hardest hit parts of \nNiger and Mali.  Dakoro, Filingu\u00e9 and Ouallam were among the worst affected zones.  While no epidemics \nwere reported  (only food deficiencies and parasites) it was noted that coping capacities appeared to be stretched \nto the limit by continuing high cereal prices that translated into poor terms of trade in the selling livestock to \nbuy cereals; \n\u2022 \nEmployment loss: Because of food insecurity, many people were migrating in increasing numbers to larger \npopulation centres in search of employment or means to gain money. Population movement was considered a \nnegative indicator as it could have a detrimental impact on families, communities and security. \n \nOn 22 July 2005, the International Federation launched an Emergency Appeal seeking CHF 18,243,483 to assist \n44,400 households over a period of six months. While the Federation Emergency Appeal put forth immediate \nresponse efforts, those longer-term in nature were left for further definition pending programme support, general \nactivity progress and evolution of the crisis at hand.  After initial emergency response efforts and with the structural \nnature of the crisis in Niger and other affected countries becoming clearer, it became apparent that the initial six-\nmonth timeframe incorporating emergency, post-crisis and developmental activities was too tight. By mid-January \n2006, activities undertaken as part of the emergency appeal had reached 644,525 people (beyond the revised target \n \n1 In French: Comit\u00e9 Inter-Etate pour la Lutte contre la S\u00e9cheresse au Sahel \n \n \n2\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nof 536,000 beneficiaries), mainly due to a high response to supplementary feeding for malnourished children and \ntheir families. The appeal was subsequently revised; the number of targeted people was increased to 76,571 families \n(536,000 beneficiaries) and the timeframe was extended until end of July 2006. In line with these changes, the \nAppeal budget was increased to CHF 31,242,371 (USD 24,051,094 or EUR 19,798,714) on 13 April 2006.  \n \nAmong the various programmes of the Sahel operation, principal beneficiaries included moderately malnourished \nchildren and their families, households suffering from severe food shortages, the elderly, the ill, orphans and \ndisadvantaged pastoralist communities. Through the Red Cross/Red Crescent intervention, the assisted populations \nbenefited from sensitization and education campaigns as well as community projects such as food-for-work, \nbuilding and repair of wells, health, nutrition and hygiene training, skill enhancement and professional \ndevelopment. \n \nThis operation was effectively planned and managed, and achieved clear impact. Based on the initial success in \ndelivering the intended assistance, initiatives were undertaken to implement plans previously outlined in the appeal, \nwith a reasonable expectation that donors would support the activities and meet their obligations accordingly. \nUnfortunately, the anticipated funding support did not materialize, but the Federation had already engaged and \ncommitted with the National Societies and other partners. As a result, the operation was faced with a considerable \ndeficit (see attached final financial report). While this may raise valid questions over financial management and \ndiscipline, the Federation will resolve the situation transparently, working with the concerned National Societies. \nFor further questions related to this issue, please refer to the list of <contact details> provided at the end of this \nreport. \n \nAnalysis of the operation - objectives, achievements and impact \n \nGoal: Provide support to the affected Red Cross and Red Crescent national societies in order to decrease and \nfurther prevent vulnerability to food insecurity and malnutrition by immediately responding in the form of \nlivelihood interventions for 76,571 households (536,000 beneficiaries) over a six-month period. [As per the \nRevised Plan of Action of 7 August 2005]. \n \nSpecific objective 1 (Relief - general food distributions): Distribute a monthly general food ration to 76,571 \nhouseholds (536,000 people) in Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger.   \n \nAchievements \n \nBurkina Faso: Food distributions in the Northern provinces of Burkina Faso were completed by the end of April \n2006. However, following a field visit undertaken by the Federation, Burkinabe Red Cross Society and the \nLuxembourg Red Cross in Yatenga, Loroum and Soum provinces in December 2005, it was found that the northern \nregions still experienced severe effects of the drought as well as \nattacks by caterpillars and seed-eating birds. In some areas, food \nstocks could potentially last only two months since some producers \nwere already eating their new crop while they harvested. The \nassessment mission concluded that distributions needed to be \ncontinued in these areas, especially Oudalan, Soum, Yatenga, Loroum, \nSoum and Oudalan provinces.  \n \nConsequently, a supplementary round of distributions was done in \nSoum, Oudalan and Yatenga, reaching 19 sites and 8,984 households \nwith approximately 998 metric tonnes (MT) of foodstuffs. Rations \ncomprised of the following: 70 kg of millet, 20 kg of rice, 15 kg of \nniebe and 6 litres of vegetable oil per household in Oudalan Province; \n60 kg of millet or sorghum, 30 kg of rice, 15 kg of niebe and 6 litres of \nvegetable oil in Soum and Yatenga provinces.  \n \nMali: Mali Red Cross distributed commodities provided by the World \nFood Programme (WFP). In total, 41,413 children, aged between 5 \nand 59 months, benefited from 1.491 MT of food.  \nThe Niger Red Cross distributes essential \nfood aid to villagers in Tigar. According to \nUN statistics, some 3.6 million of Niger\u2019s 12 \nmillion inhabitants were directly affected by \nthe food crisis. Mark Snelling/British Red \nCross. \n \n \n3\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nMali Red Cross, supported directly by the Federation, provided an additional 329 MT of food. Four distribution \nrounds were planned over 120 days and took place at 104 sites among 14 communes in Timbuktu, Goundam and \nGourma-Rharous. They targeted 10,226 children, of whom 4,036 were female. Rations were composed of 250 \ngrammes of enriched flour (CSB), 30 grammes of oil and 20 grammes of sugar per child per day.  \n \nNiger: The Federation completed its two rounds of general food distribution in Tillab\u00e9ri and Agadez provinces by \nmid-October 2005, in line with the onset of the year\u2019s harvest. An estimated 143,558 beneficiaries were reached and \nover 3.327 MT of foodstuffs distributed. \n \nGiven the immense distances involved both within and between distribution areas, two logistical hubs were \nestablished for each distribution centre \u2013 one in Filingu\u00e9 and one in Agadez. A dedicated group of Red Cross \nSociety of Niger volunteers were recruited and trained for the operation (130 in Tillab\u00e9ri and 50 in Agadez). The \nRed Cross teams worked in close cooperation with village heads and local leaders in identifying and confirming \nbeneficiaries.  \n \nImpact \nThe nutritional status of vulnerable families was markedly increased. It was estimated that calorie intake had been \nraised from 90 calories per person to 1,777 calories per person, which was within the accepted norm of 2,100 \ncalories per person. \n \nConstraints \nTargeting and initial estimates of numbers of beneficiaries for general food distributions were based on government \ncensus figures. As a result, beneficiary numbers were generally underestimated and members of semi-nomadic \ncommunities were not always included. Furthermore, relief teams identified a number of \u2018gap villages\u2019 with \nequivalent needs that had not been included in lists initially received. A degree of \u2018on-the-spot diplomacy\u2019 and \nflexibility ended up being demonstrated by Federation relief teams in allocating rations and adjusting second round \ndistributions in order to meet the needs of additional people vulnerable throughout a number of communities. \n \nThe distances and remote nature of many villages created logistical challenges and an increased workload for relief \ndistributions \u2013 in one case mules were used as a local means of transportation for general food distributions.  In \nBurkina Faso, the greatest constraints were distances between the capital, Ouagadougou, and main areas of \noperation, posing a challenge in purchasing, transport and general programme implementation. Distributions in \nareas such as Soum were complicated by the existence of large areas of swampy land following the rainy season, \nmaking access highly difficult. To counter the problem, distribution points were established in the nearest dry areas. \nAlthough new distribution points posed greater travelling distances for beneficiaries, they remained accessible by \ncart enabling the local population to still receive much needed food assistance in a fairly timely manner.   \n \nIn Mali, transport was challenging as some villages were not reachable by road; \u2018pinasses\u2019 or motorized pirogues \nwere, therefore, rented. Unfortunately, pinasses could not ensure totally secure transportation since some goods \ncould become wet and unusable and others could be lost overboard. Furthermore, the duration of distributions in \nMali was prolonged due to difficulties in the identification of children as many bear similar names.  In addition, due \nto migration habits, organizing distributions for nomadic populations was generally a challenge.  \n \nSpecific objective 2: (Health \u2013 supplementary feeding): Provide basic health services through emergency \nsupplementary feeding for targeted vulnerable children aged under five years, to a total population of 24,500 \nin Niger. \n \nAchievements \nRed Cross/Red Crescent supplementary feeding programmes were operational in Niger since 1 August 2005 in \ncooperation with the French Red Cross (who already had an established bilateral programme in Niger), the Qatari \nRed Crescent and the Spanish Red Cross in the regions of Tahoua, Maradi, Zinder, Tanout and Agadez. By the \nclose of September 2005, the government of Niger had a new protocol in place, establishing its responsibility for the \nnutritional situation in the country. By that time, the Federation was questioning the merits of a \u2018parallel system\u2019 of \na supplementary feeding being conducted by the international humanitarian community as a long-term venture. It \nbecame clear that the Federation, in partnership with the Red Cross Society of Niger needed to assist government \nregional authorities in making their health centre personnel more tangibly responsible for the management of \nmalnutrition. \n \n \n4\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nBy mid-January 2006, 48,525 moderately malnourished children had been treated through the Red Cross/Red \nCrescent supplementary feeding centres at Tahoua, Maradi, Zinder, Agadez-Arlit and Tanout. An additional 3,825 \nmoderately malnourished children were treated between February and September 2006. In addition to the treatment \nrations for malnourished children (UNIMIX), their families received protection rations, bringing the total number of \nbeneficiaries to 291,150. The protection rations were composed of 100 kg of cereals, 50 kg of beans and four litres \nof vegetable oil per month. This ration was halved after the harvest (end of October 2005), and was discontinued \ncompletely in December 2005.   \n \nConstraints  \nThe caseload of supplementary feeding centres was higher than \nexpected, putting additional strain and workload on Red Cross \nvolunteers \nand \ndelegates. \nThe \noverwhelming \nresponse \nto \nsupplementary feeding and the provision of family protection rations \n\u2013 the combination of a health programme and relief activity \u2013 posed \nchallenges for ensuring quality programming, adequate training and \nservice provision, general staff supervision and management.  \nNiger Red Cross Society volunteers weighing \na little child. According to the Niger Red \nCross, many children were moderately or \nseverely \nmalnourished \nin \nNiger. \nOlav \nSaltbones/Norwegian Red Cross. \n \nAnother main challenge for the supplementary feeding treatment \nprogramme was the prevalence of malaria and other endemic diseases \nin Niger. As a result, the health programme of the Qatari Red \nCrescent involved additional training and treatment for malaria as \npart of its supplementary feeding activities. Vaccination programmes \nwere also implemented at a number of the feeding centres. \n \nThe protection ratios that were being provided to families with \nmalnourished children were ultimately discontinued due to the \nfollowing reasons:  \n\u2022 \nAnecdotal evidence indicated that children were been kept \ndeliberately malnourished so that their families could receive \nthe rations;  \n\u2022 \nObservations by staff and volunteers showed that some \nmothers took their children to the health centres only when \nthere were distributions of family rations;  \n\u2022 \nSome women gave their children purgative plants to keep \nthem thin, thus eligible for the programme. \n \nSpecific objective 3 (relief \u2013 cash distribution): As per the Revised Plan of Action of 7 August 2005, a cash \ndistribution was foreseen targeting 20,000 beneficiaries, or 4,000 households, to communities in Niger and \nMali. \n \nAchievements \nAs of 18 November 2005, cash distributions were completed at Tanout assisting 34,278 beneficiaries (5,713 \nhouseholds) in 88 villages and three pastoralist settlements. One-time cash grants of XOF 120,000 (approximately \nUSD 240 or EUR 182), were provided to each household.  \n \nAs part of the cash project \u2013 and through a unique partnership between the Federation, British Red Cross, Swedish \nRed Cross and University of Arizona \u2013 a monitoring regime began in the aftermath of the distributions to assess \ntheir impact at household, village, market and regional levels. Quantitative and qualitative information gathering \nalso focused on the impact of cash distributions on the nutritional status of recipient and non-recipient households. \nThe report of the evaluation is available upon request.  \n \nIn summary (according to the Phase III evaluation report), households that received financial support from the Red \nCross/Red Crescent were less likely to be indebted (4.9 per cent compared to 25.3 per cent). Among indebted \nhouseholds, cash recipients were lesser in debt compared to those who did not receive cash (average amount to be \nrepaid XOF 24,514 for cash villages and XOF 64,625 for control villages). These findings support reports from \n \n \n5\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nPhase I and II evaluations, which indicated that households used financial resources from the Red Cross cash \ndistribution to pay off loans and reduce indebtedness. The reports are available upon request. \n \nImpact \nAssistance was provided to 5,713 vulnerable families at a critical juncture in the yearly cycle, by providing them \nwith the means to manage their immediate economic needs and reestablish their households on a more secure \nfinancial footing.  \n \nConstraints \nOpposition to cash distribution by some non-governmental and international organizations, coupled with unclear \nsupport from the authorities, led to a degree of confusion that came close to derailing the project. A last-minute \nmessage received from the Governor of Zinder, conveyed through the Head of the CCA (who is responsible to the \nCabinet and Office of the Prime Minister), temporarily suspended cash distributions just prior to the scheduled start \nof the project. Following extensive negotiations, a formal agreement with the government was reached, sanctioned \nby the President of Niger, with full support from the Red Cross Society of Niger. \n \nLack of banking facilities in Tanout and surrounding remote villages led to some logistical and security challenges. \nHowever, these were successfully addressed and the project progressed well. \n \nSpecific objective 4 (Logistics, administration and telecoms): Immediately augment the existing Red Cross \nand Red Crescent National Societies with logistical, administrative and telecommunications infrastructure in \nthe four different countries of the Sahel operation. \n \nAchievements \n \nIT/Telecoms: The Mali Red Cross benefited from the presence of an IT/Telecoms delegate during the first six \nmonths of the Sahel operation when the main installations were done. The Sahel operation IT/Telecoms team \ninstalled a wide area network/local area network (WAN/LAN) with an access point and Internet connection for \napproximately 15 users. A counterpart from the National Society was recruited and trained; before leaving Mali, the \nSahel operation IT/Telecom team handed over to the IT/telecom counterpart who would ensure proper maintenance \nof the equipment, with support from the team in Niamey. A total of five laptops and three radios were provided by \nthe British Red Cross and two new desktops, one network printer and radios by the Federation.  \n \nIn Mauritania, the Federation installed three high frequency (HF) and very high frequency (VHF) bases in Zoucrete, \nNouakchott and Nema/Nouadibhou, and two mobile HF and VHF units (with 15 handsets), in response to \npopulation movements.   \n \nIn Burkina Faso, the British Red Cross provided the Burkinabe Faso \nRed Cross Society with four laptops, two Thuraya satellite phones as \nwell as HF and VHF equipment in two vehicles.  \n \nIn addition to IT/telecom bases that already existed in Niger, the \nFederation provided the Red Cross Society of Niger with one laptop, \ntwo desktops, one network printer, two HF and VHF bases for Niamey \nand Tahoua as well as two HF and VHF mobiles and 15 handsets. An \nIT/telecom counterpart was recruited and trained, and an Internet \nconnection was provided. \n \nLogistics: Overall, logistics of the operation functioned well, despite \nsome under-staffing and staff change challenges. The fleet in Niger \nran at full capacity, with 31 Federation vehicles and 11 rental vehicles \ncovering over 200,000 km a month, often over difficult terrain. The \noperation in Mali was also a logistical success, as commodities were delivered to a much dispersed set of \nbeneficiaries, also over very challenging terrains.   \nInternational Federation officials preparing \nTSU trucks for food distributions in Niger. \nOlav Saltbones/Norwegian Red Cross. \n \n \n \n6\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \n                                                \nFor the distributions that were undertaken in Burkina Faso, 333.5 MT of rice, sorghum and oil were transported \nfrom the Red Cross Society of Niger/Federation/Transport Support Unit (TSU) warehouse in Niamey to the various \ndistribution sites. Two Federation logisticians were dispatched from Niger to support the relief delegate and the \nBurkinabe Red Cross Society to complete the distributions and to assess the National Society\u2019s capacities.  \n \nIn Filingue-Abala (Niger), as part of food-for-work activities, a sub-office and warehouse were temporarily \nestablished at Abala.  Ten Transport Support Unit trucks were dispatched as part of the food-for-work effort, and a \nstock of 200 MT of cereals was put in place. TSU operational hubs were based in Tahoua and Maradi, with \napproximately 20 trucks in each location and 30 trucks remaining in Niamey.  \n \nLogistics training in Niamey was completed, with similar training (for about 10 people per session for 3 days) \nundertaken in Zinder, Agadez, Tillabery, Tahoua and Maradi. The warehouse and compound of the Red Cross \nSociety of Niger were also renovated to include a new entry zone, an improved grading to protect the area against \nground water and rains as well as new roofing. \n \nApart from supporting the Federation and other Red Cross/Red Crescent activities, the TSU supported WFP \ncooperating partners such as Action Against Hunger (ACF 2), Concern and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) \nthrough \u2018cluster deployments\u2019 of up to ten trucks.  \n \nImpact \nThe logistics team supported Federation operations and Partner National Society programmes, concentrating its \nactivities on the general food distributions and supplementary feeding programmes. Though the enormous distances \nthat had to be covered (compounded by an often unreliable supply chain) posed some challenges, beneficiary needs \nwere met in a timely and regular manner. \n \nConstraints \nIn Burkina Faso, internal and external communications were hampered by a lack of equipment, difficult and \nunreliable connections and a lack of available technical personnel to pursue implementation of IT/telecoms activities. \n \nThe long distances involved in transporting goods across the region, the quality of the transport infrastructure and \nweather conditions at certain times, compounded by an unreliable supply chain, posed challenges for operational \nlogistics. Despite the constraints, the Federation possessed a dynamic logistics team able to overcome obstacles so \nthat beneficiary demands could be met in a timely and regular manner.   \n \nAmong logistical challenges, one difficulty was the imposition by the Government of Niger on limits of tonnage for \ntrucks passing through Niamey. Shipments for a number of organizations, most notably the Federation, WFP and \nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), were blocked in transit due to the new regulations which levied fines of \nXOF 10,000 per metric tonne on cargo exceeding 25 metric tonnes. In response, the Federation sought and received \na temporary exemption for its food commodities that were already en route. \n \nThe receipt of food commodities was a complicated process since limited information tended to be provided by \nfreight forwarders regarding expected delivery times. Discussions with freight forwarders on behalf of Sahel \nOperation staff improved the situation, resulting in the ultimate receipt of all goods.  \n \nSpecific objective 5 (Relief - livestock interventions for Mali and Niger): As per the Revised Plan of Action of \n7 August 2005, it was anticipated that 5,000 pastoralists would be assisted in Mali and Niger.   \n \nAchievements  \nThe food distributions also provided the opportunity to undertake parallel activities in the area of livestock health \nand support. On 11 November 2005, livestock vaccination sensitization campaigns started in different villages in the \nSalam Region, in cooperation with the Malian Ministry of Livestock. Radio stations broadcasted campaign \ninformation in four local languages and heads of villages were contacted as part of the sensitization process.   \n \n \n2 In French: Action Contre la Faim \n \n \n7\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \n                                                \nIn turn, 15,897 heads of livestock were vaccinated in Salam and Gourma Rharous. The number of cattle attended to \nwas well above the original target of 10,000, despite reticence amongst pastoralists in identifying exact numbers of \ncattle due to taxation implications.  \n \nIn December 2005 and January 2006, two rounds of fodder distributions were undertaken in the Salam Region. \nTheir purpose was to ensure livestock fodder consumption, prevent livestock sales on the markets and guarantee \nfodder in cold periods. There were two main breeder selection criteria; at least one malnourished child in the \nhousehold and breeders had to own between 10 and 50 livestock heads. Roughly 10,400 livestock heads benefited \nfrom fodder distributions totalling 180 MT. \n \nImpact \nReinforcing vulnerable livestock, thereby enabling on-going viability of pastoralist communities through a livestock \nvaccination programme and the distribution of fodder, enabled them to build up their livestock capacity so as to \nsurvive the extreme temperatures period that begins in December. \n \nSpecific objective 6 (Relief - cereal bank support for Mali and Niger): As per the Revised Plan of Action of 7 \nAugust 2005, it was anticipated that food stocks could be placed at cereal banks in 250 of the worst affected \ncommunities in Mali and Niger. \n \nAchievements \nAs monitoring progressed, it became evident that cereal banks could be a means of further assisting people affected \nby drought in Niger. Preliminary investigations suggested that as many as 50 villages could benefit from cereal \nbanks as a means of enhancing their longer-term food security.   \n \nA project manager from the British Red Cross arrived in Niger to develop a pilot cereal bank project, along with \nacademic staff from the University of Arizona. In addition to the funding provided by the British Red Cross, the \nFederation agreed to provide logistics support for the research and implementation phases of the pilot project.  \n \nVillage lands were identified, sites were confirmed using the Global Positioning System (GPS) and official \ndocuments were signed by village chiefs who authorized allocation of the land. A total of 21 cereal banks were \nconstructed in villages around Tanout; construction was completed in July, 2006, before the onset of the rainy \nseason. The banks were built using cement bricks, concrete and steel. The rationale for using these materials to \nbuild the cereal banks, instead of local traditional materials, was based on research done (reflecting on the use of \nboth types of products) with an important factor being the reduction of overhead costs, thus contributing to longer-\nterm sustainability. \n \nTwenty one village committees for cereal bank management were created and a three-day management training was \nconducted. Several items, including tables, chairs, notebooks, pens and cleaning products for the cereal banks, were \nprovided. Since the cereal banks began operating during the lean season, rice sales started immediately after \nconstruction was completed and management committees were in place.   \n \nAccording to the original design, households were required to pay a XOF 500 membership fee in order to purchase \ncereals3 from the banks. In Farak, 200 households were active in the cereal banks, with each household eligible to \npurchase up to five tias per week.  Funds collected from the sales were to be kept until after the harvest, when prices \ndropped significantly and more cereals could be purchased for use in the next lean season. \n \nConstraints \nDue to the requirement to pay membership fees, it was found out that 30 per cent of households were not accessing \nfood in the banks by July 2006. Management committees were primarily comprised of men, and it was not possible \nto ascertain whether the most vulnerable households were represented in the committees. Given that literacy and \nnumeracy skills were some of the criteria used to select members of the committee, it is likely that the most \nvulnerable households were not represented. In Farak, CARE had been working for two years, providing support to \n \n3 During a post-operation evaluation of the project, a meeting with women in Farak village revealed that they were paying XOF \n850 per tia of rice in the banks, compared to XOF 1,100 in the market.    \n \n \n8\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \n                                                \nwomen\u2019s village banks. The skills gained by the women in managing cereal banks could have been capitalized upon \nin setting up the management committee for the Red Cross-supported cereal banks. Women, who had proven their \nability to manage the savings of village banks and had gained the trust of their members, could have formed the \nmanagement committees. The Red Cross has realized this and in future, such interventions shall take into \nconsideration available skills and gender balance. \n \nSpecific objective 7 (Health \u2013 post-emergency health for Niger): Sustainable health interventions to promote \nresilience and improve the longer-term health of the most vulnerable are advocated.   \n \nAchievements \n \nMalnutrition strategy \nAs part of the technical support-transition process for the integrated health centres (CSI)4, and on behalf of the \nFederation and the Red Cross Society of Niger, 60 health officers and 30 general staff were trained in malnutrition \nscreening and treatment (according to the national protocol), and supplementary feeding stock management. The \ntraining and integration of services was undertaken in 15 health centres, including Hadachimo, Mogheur, Dangona, \nMaboya, Ill\u00e9la, Bagaroua, S\u00e9hia, T\u00e9baram, Toulou, Edir, Dandoutchi, Taja\u00e9, Dandaji and Moull\u00e9la. As part of the \nintegration strategy, the Federation trained 40 Red Cross Society of Niger volunteers who will continue providing \ntechnical support to community health centres.  \n \nBecause chronic malnutrition is a result of specific behaviours towards food and hygiene, the main focus of the \nSahel operation health team at Tahoua was educating key people (matrons within communities and Red Cross \nSociety of Niger volunteers) as agents who would sensitize and mobilize the local populations. To this end, 60 \nmatrons and 40 Red Cross Society of Niger volunteers working with the CSI in Tahoua and Ill\u00e9la districts were \ntrained in nutrition information, education and communication (IEC).  \n \nMatrons were considered key people as they are usually the traditional advisers of mothers on children\u2019s health \nissues within communities. Training sessions for matrons typically lasted two days while for volunteers took one \nday. A training of trainers (ToT) session for Red Cross Society of Niger counterparts in nutrition and education was \nalso undertaken through the health programme in Tahoua. In addition, 150 training sessions on nutrition followed in \nJuly 2006.  \n \nMobile health \nFollowing a pilot mobile health team project initiated in October 2005 in the Tahoua area, a Memorandum of \nUnderstanding was entered into with the regional health authorities for on-going delivery of much needed basic \nhealth care to remote communities that lacked access to basic health services.  \n \nIn November 2005, three mobile clinics were set up in Tahoua, with five trained volunteers in each. They visited 48 \ndifferent sites (120 villages in three different health districts), often together with the major (nurse) from the nearest \nhealth centre. During the visits, they vaccinated children aged under five years, made prenatal and post natal \nconsultations, sensitized women on basic health issues, conducted malnutrition screening, and provided de-worming \nmedication.  \n \nBetween March and August 2006, 9,888 children had been vaccinated and 1,906 de-wormed. The vaccination \ncoverage in the region where the clinics were operating was more than 90 per cent. 2,674 prenatal consultations \nwere held where women were vaccinated, and 3,731 malnourished children were identified and sent to malnutrition \ncentres. About 8,196 women were reached with messages/information on breastfeeding issues, weaning, diarrhoea, \nvaccination of new-borns, malaria, use of mosquito nets, food-environmental-and body hygiene, and family \nplanning. \n \nImpact \nThe mobile health teams contributed to the improvement of access to primary health in the Tahoua region. Due to \nimproved access, the vaccination coverage amongst children under 11 months was increased in the region and in \nother areas of operation under the supplementary feeding programmes. \n \n \n4 In French: Centre de Sant\u00e9 Int\u00e9gr\u00e9 (CSI) \n \n \n9\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nConstraint \nDistances to these remote villages were great, sometimes between 150 and 230 km, and road access was non-\nexistent.  \n \nSpecific objective 8: Water and sanitation (WatSan), Niger \n \nAchievements \nFollowing an assessment mission undertaken in September 2005, a number of potential water and sanitation \nactivities were outlined that were to be implemented immediately or over the mid-term and longer-term. Among the \nactivities were the following: construction and rehabilitation of well; construction and rehabilitation of school \nlatrines; and construction and rehabilitation of family latrines. With assistance from the Swedish Red Cross, \nimplementation of WatSan activities began. The programme was later scaled up with financial support from the \nQatari Red Crescent and it is being implemented after the close of the Sahel operation.  \n \nEighty volunteers from the Red Cross Society of Niger were trained in Participatory Hygiene and Sanitation \nTransformation (PHAST), a methodology that builds on people\u2019s innate ability to address and resolve their own \nproblems. In turn, the Red Cross volunteers trained community-based volunteers in the targeted villages; the Red \nCross volunteers were equipped with motorbikes to facilitate easy reach (five villages per volunteer). More than 70 \nof these volunteers conducted sensitization activities in 235 villages of Tahoua, Tillabery and Zinder. In Tahoua and \nin Filingu\u00e9, 110 water management committees have been formed and their members trained. The committees are \nnow responsible for managing the wells constructed/rehabilitated under the project. Similar committees will be \nestablished in Zinder. The WatSan activities will continue until end of July 2007. \n \nImpact \nHygiene promotion, using the PHAST methodology, in Tahoua contributed towards cholera prevention \u2013 in 2006 \u2013 \nin areas where cholera is endemic, such as in Bouza.   \n \nConstraints \nAt the beginning, implementation of activities was slow because there were no community-based volunteers in the \ntargeted villages. Due to delays in implementation, water and sanitation activities should continue for two years to \nassure the ownership of the infrastructure by the beneficiaries. \n \nSpecific objective 9: Logistics \u2013 capacity building  \n \nAchievements \nDifferent trainings were provided to the Red Cross Society of Niger volunteers and staff. The sessions include a \ntraining that was held in Niamey for 15 members of the governance and executive branches of the National Society. \nThe five-day workshop covered issues such as project planning, logistics, preparedness and response, procurement, \nwarehousing and transport management as well as IT/telecommunications. During the last day of training, a visit to \nthe National Society\u2019s warehouse and a brainstorming session were undertaken about the future of logistics within \nthe Red Cross Society of Niger. Three days of training were also held for volunteers and staff members in Zinder, \nAgadez, Tillabery, Tahoua and Maradi.  \n \nAn emergency stock of 1,000 MT of cereals was pre-positioned for the Red Cross Society of Niger at its Niamey \nwarehouse. The emergency stock was treated as per Federation standards, with National Society staff members \ntrained in warehousing techniques. In the framework of the general logistics training, a specific module on \nwarehousing was provided. At the Red Cross Society of Niger Tahoua base, a logistics counterpart was fully \nintegrated into Federation activities.   \n \nSpecific objective 10: Relief-livelihoods capacity building in Niger. \n \nAchievements \n \nLivelihoods small grants programme \nThe small grants project was implemented by the Irish Red Cross in Agadez and divided into two parts; family \ngrants and collective grants for micro-projects. Family grants were meant to assist vulnerable families until the next \nrainy season and reinforce their coping mechanisms in future by contributing to replenishment of their household \n \n \n10\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \neconomy. Collective grants for micro-projects were oriented towards reinforcement of food security of local \ncommunities.  \n \nAfter a series of surveys and assessments, the Irish Red Cross, as the manager of the activity, decided to provide \ngrants to ten per cent of the vulnerable populations in each village (people aged over 60 years, and \npregnant/lactating women). Focus groups, with women, revealed that small animals were considered the highest \npriority to improve livelihood security; some women identified food as their greatest need while others indicated the \nneed for alternative sources of income, such as weaving palm frond for sale in the local market.  \nAccordingly, the Red Cross implemented a programme where staff, with support from branch volunteers, purchased \nsmall ruminants (sheep and goats) in bulk for distribution to targeted households. Beneficiaries participated in \nassessing the general health of the animals before they were purchased. Cereals were also purchased in bulk and \ngiven to extremely vulnerable households, based on family size. Finally, palm fronds were provided directly to \nwomen to make mats, and the Red Cross volunteers assisted in marketing.  This programme ended in August 2006. \n \nFood-for-work projects: In Mali, in addition to relief food distributions, \u2018food for work\u2019 and \u2018food-for-training\u2019 \nprogrammes were implemented up to end of November 2005. \u2018Food-for-work\u2019 and \u2018food-for-training\u2019 distributions \nwere made at the beginning and the end of the work/training sessions, and they aimed at protecting the child rations \nalready distributed. Among the food-for-work projects were dyke construction, reforestation, water pipe \nconstruction, irrigation, warehouse construction and market gardening.  \n \nFood-for-training projects were mainly oriented towards HIV/AIDS sensitization, elimination of illiteracy and \nnutrition education. Beneficiaries received 2 kg of cereals and 75 grammes of oil per day when participating in a \nfood-for-work project and 1.2 kg of cereals and 45 grammes of oil per day when participating in a training session. \n \nIn Niger, following an initial assessment and discussions with community members on the most important needs at \nthe community level, food-for-work projects were designed and implemented in Agadez, in Filingue-Abala, and in \nTahoua.   \n \nA pilot project was undertaken in Fadama and Tillimoune, two villages north of Abala and close to the Mali border. \nActivities in both villages focused on provision of water and agriculture. They included: \n\u2022 \nSoil recuperation and improvement of a water catchment in Fadama and Tillimoune; \n\u2022 \nRehabilitation of a community well in Fadama and Tillimoune. \n \nBy July 2006, 1,113 workers had benefited from the food-for-work projects in Tillimoune and Fadama. In \nTillimoune, the projects included well rehabilitation and soil rehabilitation (through construction of half moons), \nconstruction of stone walls and planting trees. Rehabilitation of wells was completed, and 2,630 forest half moons, \n5,008 agricultural half-moons and 4.16 km of stone lines were installed. More than 6,000 trees were planted. In \nFadama, in addition to soil rehabilitation, there were three additional projects; one to deepen a pond (to make it a \nyear-round catchment area), the second to build four micro-dams (to slow down water flow so that water would \nfilter down to the water table), and the third to rehabilitate a deep well. All projects were identified by communities. \nWell reconstruction and the four micro-dams were completed.  \n \nIn Tahoua, four food-for-work projects were conducted to recuperate 80 hectares of land through the construction of \nhalf-moons and planting acacia trees. A total of 23,710 half-moons were dug, and 5,200 acacia trees were planted.  \nA rotation system for teams of workers was established so that each team would work for one day out of three, \nleaving the other two days available for working in their fields. At least 719 persons, including 77 branch volunteers \nand 10 technical specialists, worked in the projects and received sufficient food to meet their family needs for one \nmonth.    \n \nImpact \nThe assistance provided to 5,713 vulnerable families at a critical juncture in the yearly cycle, helped them with the \nmeans to manage their immediate economic needs and re-establish their households on a more secure financial \nfooting.  \n \n \n \n11\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nThe relatively substantial cash grant provided vulnerable households with a choice in coping mechanisms. \nEvaluation reports indicate that families that benefited from small grants used the funds to buy foodstuffs, cattle and \nnecessary household implements, such as carts, and to pay off debts. This showed that households prioritized \ninvesting in their longer-term economic viability over shorter-term needs. \n \nHouseholds were not constrained to pay off debts by selling their harvest at a loss. Cash-in-hand enabled agro-\npastoralist communities to decide when to buy and when to sell, thereby ensuring better management of their \nharvest and livestock. It also enabled stockpiling of millet, to help families apportion their harvest to last them \nthrough the lean period, which soon followed.  \n \nConstraints \nUnfortunately, one of the dams constructed in Fadama did not hold, and there was insufficient time remaining in the \nproject to rehabilitate the dam. In addition, trees were not planted as expected and the Red Cross eventually gave \n2,000 of the trees to the Department of the Environment for planting elsewhere. \n \nSpecific objective 11 (Reporting-media-communications \u2013 advocacy and public information): Promote and \ndisseminate within the target audience the activities highlighted in the Supplementary Plan of Action \u2013 \nAppeal Extension and overall Sahel operation.    \n \nAchievements  \nThroughout the operation, the Federation information delegate held regular interviews with international, local and \nregional media. The delegate also accompanied camera teams to the field, and briefed journalists interested in the \nrelief operation as well as communication teams of Partner National Societies. In addition, key documents, \nphotographs and fact sheets were developed and shared with partners, stakeholders and national societies interested \nand/or involved in the operation. Articles were published on the Federation\u2019s website and a dedicated section \nfocusing on the Sahel food crisis was created.  \n \nContinuous training was provided to the Federation regional information officer, in Dakar, on the professional role \nforeseen within the Federation, focusing on information-gathering during disasters and reporting. This aimed at \nensuring continuity of highlighting forgotten disasters once the operation closed. In addition, documents on \ninformation management during disasters \u2013 produced by the Inter-Americas Communicators Network \u2013 were shared \nwith the Red Cross Society of Niger press officer.  \n \nTraining packages on promotion of Humanitarian Values and Red Cross principles, including information on the \nCode of Conduct of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief, were given to \nFederation staff and Partner National Societies working in the Sahel operation (in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger). \nThe aim was to reinforce knowledge of Red Cross principles and values among the volunteers involved in the food-\ncrisis operation, especially newcomers. \n \nCoordination \n \nWithin the Red Cross/Red Crescent Movement \nCoordination and cooperation within logistics, human resources and programme support was established between \nthe Federation and Participating National Societies, in particular the French Red Cross, the Irish Red Cross, the \nQatari Red Crescent, the Saudi Arabian Red Crescent and the Spanish Red Cross. As the Sahel operation developed, \ncontact was also established with the Iranian Red Crescent as it has a long-standing and noteworthy presence in \nNiger.  \n \nThe Federation regional delegation in Dakar facilitated and coordinated the deployment of Regional Disaster \nResponse Team (RDRT) members from West Africa. Staff provided by the National Societies of Algeria, Benin, \nCameroon, Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Nigeria and Togo played a crucial role since the \nearliest stages of the operation. Their involvement was pivotal for the development, implementation and success of \nvarious activities. It signalled the reliable expertise available throughout different countries in the region.   \n \nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) provided regular security updates. ICRC also provided \ntraining for volunteers from the Red Cross Society of Niger, in Tahoua.  \n \n \n12\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nWith beneficiaries \nAt the local and regional-country level, relief and supplementary feeding activities were undertaken in collaboration \nwith local and provincial authorities to facilitate coordination while underlining and ensuring respect for \nFundamental Principles of the Red Cross Movement. Heads of villages were, in particular, closely linked to the Red \nCross/Red Crescent response due to their pivotal role within communities.   \n \nWith government agencies \nAn effective working relationship was established with the main governmental bodies involved in the crisis \u2013 such \nas Cellule de Crise Alimentaire (CCA) and Syst\u00e8me d\u2019Alerte Pr\u00e9coce (SAP) \u2013 and with key government of Niger \nministries, in cooperation with the Red Cross Society of Niger. The ministries included the Ministry of Health and \nthe Ministry of Community Development.  In Tahoua (Niger), the Red Cross/Red Crescent worked very closely \nwith regional government health staff. This facilitated competency development and the eventual transfer of \nsupplementary feeding centres to the government.    \n \nWith other agencies \nSince the onset of the Sahel operation, the Federation collaborated closely with United Nations agencies \n(particularly in the organization of transport services and provision of food assistance), and the broader \nhumanitarian community, most notably in the health sector.   \n \nThe operation had a series of partnerships, which enabled the Red Cross/Red Crescent to draw on other forms of \nexpertise, as well as additional financial resources to support the activities. Collegial support for various Federation \nactivities was received from organizations such as Concern, GOAL, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), Oxfam and \nSave the Children-UK.   \n \nThrough the Transport Support Unit (TSU), the Federation developed relationships with WFP and its implementing \npartners. Greater numbers of beneficiaries were assisted on a timely basis through food distribution and food-for-\nwork than would have been possible had the TSU not been established.   \n \nThe Spanish Red Cross in Maradi had an agreement with MSF-France, where severely malnourished children \nwould be referred to MSF for treatment, and moderately malnourished children seeking assistance at MSF clinics \nwould be referred to Red Cross clinics for treatment.   \n \nThe British Red Cross contracted the services of the University of Arizona to monitor the impact of the cash \ndistribution project in Tanout. This had the effect of bringing in highly qualified experts who provided objectivity in \nmonitoring data and impact. \n \nConcern referred children (when they have reached 80 per cent of their weight) from its acute malnutrition feed \ncentres to the Red Cross/Red Crescent. Concern invested considerable time to ensure that its supplementary feeding \nactivities did not overlap those of the Red Cross.   \n \nNational Society Capacity Building \nIn general, all sectors of the intervention contained elements for training and support of volunteers and staff of Host \nNational Societies. Among the various aspects of the Sahel operation, a network of more than 360 volunteers was \ntrained as part of the initial emergency response in the areas of relief, health care, logistics, administration, \ntelecommunications, reporting and media relations. In a relatively short time, their knowledge of the Red Cross/Red \nCrescent Movement was greatly enhanced. As key players in an operational partnership, volunteers and staff \nconsistently showed their dedication and skills.     \n \nThe counterpart system was very successful, especially in supplementary feeding centres, mobile health clinics, \ncommunity health, water and sanitation, and food-for-work. In all these sectors, activities were implemented using \ncounterparts from local Red Cross branches.   \n \nTraining of Burkinabe Red Cross Society volunteers in registration and distribution procedures was undertaken in \nconjunction with its first aid section. In each province of Burkina Faso, a team of 30 volunteers supported by a \nsupervisor, team leader and logistician was established. Volunteers were then deployed to the various target areas or \n\u2018d\u00e9partements\u2019 within the province and the supervisor/team leader continued to work alongside the volunteers. \n \n \n13\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nWith support from the operation, the Tahoua branch of the Red Cross Society of Niger rehabilitated its offices, \nincreased its professional competency and strengthened its financial management capability. A number of \nvolunteers were trained and they in turn provided support to local health centres and other key community health \nactivities. The branch also developed its logistics capacity to provide necessary support, when needed, in Tahoua. \n \nMonitoring and evaluation \nWith a variety of Movement actors continuing their presence in Niger following the closure of the operation, a \nfocused evaluation was commissioned by the Federation to review efforts undertaken under the Sahel Operation. \nThe evaluation particularly emphasized on Niger (which was the most affected country, and where the operation \nreally focused on), to help determine how the remaining actors can capitalize on their presence, interests and \nstrengths in reflection of continuing needs in the country.  \n \nThe evaluation focused on three thematic areas: appropriateness of the disaster response intervention; processes; \nand relationships. The findings indicate that through the Sahel operation, the Red Cross/Red Crescent contributed to \nthe reduction of the short-term effects of the drought. The Red Cross/Red Crescent intervention helped to reduce \nfood insecurity and addressed the needs of moderately malnourished children, among others. \n \nFor further information specifically related to this operation please contact: \n\u2022 \nIn Dakar: Alasan Senghore, Federation Head of Zone for West and Central Africa, Dakar; email: \nalasan.senghore@ifrc.org; telephone +221.869.36.41; fax +221.860.20.02. \n \nAll International Federation assistance seeks to adhere to the Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and \nRed Crescent Movement and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO's) in Disaster Relief and is committed to the \nHumanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards in Disaster Response (Sphere) in delivering assistance to the most \nvulnerable. \n \nFor longer-term programmes in this or other countries or regions, please refer to the Federation\u2019s Annual Appeal. \nFor support to or for further information concerning Federation programmes or operations in this or other \ncountries, or for national society profiles, please also access the Federation\u2019s website at http://www.ifrc.org\n \n \n<Final financial report below; click here to return to the title page> \n \n \n14\nSelected Parameters\nReporting Timeframe\n2005/4-2007/8\nBudget Timeframe\n2005/4-2007/8\nAppeal\nM05EA015\nBudget\nAPPEAL\nAll figures are in Swiss Francs (CHF)\nFinal Financial Report\nM05EA015 - BURKINA FASO, MALI, MAURITANIA & NIGER: FOOD INSEC\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies\nI.

Funds have been reimbursed. \n \nThis operation was aligned with the International Federation's Global Agenda, which sets out four broad \ngoals to meet the Federation's mission to \"improve the lives of vulnerable people by mobilizing the power of \nhumanity\". \n \nGlobal Agenda Goals: \n\u2022 \nReduce the numbers of deaths, injuries and impact from disasters. \n\u2022 \nReduce the number of deaths, illnesses and impact from diseases and public health emergencies. \n\u2022 \nIncrease local community, civil society and Red Cross/Red Crescent capacity to address the most \nurgent situations of vulnerability. \n\u2022 \nReduce intolerance, discrimination and social exclusion and promote respect for diversity and \nhuman dignity. \n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \n                                                \nBackground and summary \nIn 2004 and 2005, countries of the Sahel region experienced the worst locust invasion of 20 years coupled with low \nrainfalls and drought conditions. This situation resulted in a severe food crisis and heightened malnutrition in many \nlocations of Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger. Niger was, however, the most affected country.  \n \nAs part of its overall stewardship for West Africa, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent \nSocieties regional delegation in Dakar closely monitored the situation. Through several assessment and support \nmissions to the concerned countries, the delegation assisted National Societies in disseminating warnings of \nupcoming food insecurity to affected communities as well as governments, national and international organizations.  \n \nAs the food security situation became increasingly alarming, the \nregional delegation deployed a three-member team comprising one \nconsultant and two Regional Disaster Response Team (RDRT) \nmembers to carry out a detailed assessment of the food security \nsituation in Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali and Mauritania and to assist \nthe National Societies in identifying their role in addressing the issue \nconsidering \ntheir \nexperience \nand \noperational \ncapacities. \nIn \ncoordination with the UN Office for the Coordination of \nHumanitarian Affairs (OCHA), World Food Programme (WFP), the \nUN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), other organizations \nand governments, the team developed recommendations for the \nFederation on ways of providing support to National Societies in the \nregion and possible interventions. Based on the findings of the \nassessments and information collected through secondary sources, the \nmain justifications for an emergency intervention were as follows: \nVillagers in drought-hit Tigar, Niger, gather \nfor a Red Cross food distribution. A \ncombination of drought and a locust invasion \nleft many parts of the Sahel region \ndesperately \nshort \nof \nfood. \nMark \nSnelling/British Red Cross. \n\u2022 \nLoss of life: There was increasing evidence from M\u00e9decins Sans \nFronti\u00e8res (MSF) and other sources that children were dying \u2013 \nparticularly in Niger \u2013 as a result of the crisis in the Sahel region;    \n\u2022 \nFood and health loss: Agricultural production in Niger during 2004 was severely affected by the locust invasion \nand drought.  Estimates from an assessment mission by the government, WFP, Famine Early Warning System \nNetwork (FEWS NET) and the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control (CILSS1) in March 2005 \nconcluded that 2.5 million people \u2013 approximately 20 percent of Niger\u2019s population \u2013 were food insecure and \nrequired food assistance.  The loss in cereal production was approximately 15 per cent compared to the average \nannual production over the last five years, or a grain deficit of about 225,000 metric tonnes (MT) for the year \n2005. While Mali, Burkina Faso and Mauritania were not as severely affected, they were still part of the same \ndisaster situation and needed support to discourage a further deterioration of the situation;     \n\u2022 \nLivestock loss: Livestock \u2013 particularly cattle, horses and donkeys that were least resistant to drought \u2013 were \nseverely affected by fodder shortages. Many dead carcasses were visible throughout the hardest hit parts of \nNiger and Mali.  Dakoro, Filingu\u00e9 and Ouallam were among the worst affected zones.  While no epidemics \nwere reported  (only food deficiencies and parasites) it was noted that coping capacities appeared to be stretched \nto the limit by continuing high cereal prices that translated into poor terms of trade in the selling livestock to \nbuy cereals; \n\u2022 \nEmployment loss: Because of food insecurity, many people were migrating in increasing numbers to larger \npopulation centres in search of employment or means to gain money. Population movement was considered a \nnegative indicator as it could have a detrimental impact on families, communities and security. \n \nOn 22 July 2005, the International Federation launched an Emergency Appeal seeking CHF 18,243,483 to assist \n44,400 households over a period of six months. While the Federation Emergency Appeal put forth immediate \nresponse efforts, those longer-term in nature were left for further definition pending programme support, general \nactivity progress and evolution of the crisis at hand.  After initial emergency response efforts and with the structural \nnature of the crisis in Niger and other affected countries becoming clearer, it became apparent that the initial six-\nmonth timeframe incorporating emergency, post-crisis and developmental activities was too tight. By mid-January \n2006, activities undertaken as part of the emergency appeal had reached 644,525 people (beyond the revised target \n \n1 In French: Comit\u00e9 Inter-Etate pour la Lutte contre la S\u00e9cheresse au Sahel \n \n \n2\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nof 536,000 beneficiaries), mainly due to a high response to supplementary feeding for malnourished children and \ntheir families. The appeal was subsequently revised; the number of targeted people was increased to 76,571 families \n(536,000 beneficiaries) and the timeframe was extended until end of July 2006. In line with these changes, the \nAppeal budget was increased to CHF 31,242,371 (USD 24,051,094 or EUR 19,798,714) on 13 April 2006.  \n \nAmong the various programmes of the Sahel operation, principal beneficiaries included moderately malnourished \nchildren and their families, households suffering from severe food shortages, the elderly, the ill, orphans and \ndisadvantaged pastoralist communities. Through the Red Cross/Red Crescent intervention, the assisted populations \nbenefited from sensitization and education campaigns as well as community projects such as food-for-work, \nbuilding and repair of wells, health, nutrition and hygiene training, skill enhancement and professional \ndevelopment. \n \nThis operation was effectively planned and managed, and achieved clear impact. Based on the initial success in \ndelivering the intended assistance, initiatives were undertaken to implement plans previously outlined in the appeal, \nwith a reasonable expectation that donors would support the activities and meet their obligations accordingly. \nUnfortunately, the anticipated funding support did not materialize, but the Federation had already engaged and \ncommitted with the National Societies and other partners. As a result, the operation was faced with a considerable \ndeficit (see attached final financial report). While this may raise valid questions over financial management and \ndiscipline, the Federation will resolve the situation transparently, working with the concerned National Societies. \nFor further questions related to this issue, please refer to the list of <contact details> provided at the end of this \nreport. \n \nAnalysis of the operation - objectives, achievements and impact \n \nGoal: Provide support to the affected Red Cross and Red Crescent national societies in order to decrease and \nfurther prevent vulnerability to food insecurity and malnutrition by immediately responding in the form of \nlivelihood interventions for 76,571 households (536,000 beneficiaries) over a six-month period. [As per the \nRevised Plan of Action of 7 August 2005]. \n \nSpecific objective 1 (Relief - general food distributions): Distribute a monthly general food ration to 76,571 \nhouseholds (536,000 people) in Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger.   \n \nAchievements \n \nBurkina Faso: Food distributions in the Northern provinces of Burkina Faso were completed by the end of April \n2006. However, following a field visit undertaken by the Federation, Burkinabe Red Cross Society and the \nLuxembourg Red Cross in Yatenga, Loroum and Soum provinces in December 2005, it was found that the northern \nregions still experienced severe effects of the drought as well as \nattacks by caterpillars and seed-eating birds. In some areas, food \nstocks could potentially last only two months since some producers \nwere already eating their new crop while they harvested. The \nassessment mission concluded that distributions needed to be \ncontinued in these areas, especially Oudalan, Soum, Yatenga, Loroum, \nSoum and Oudalan provinces.  \n \nConsequently, a supplementary round of distributions was done in \nSoum, Oudalan and Yatenga, reaching 19 sites and 8,984 households \nwith approximately 998 metric tonnes (MT) of foodstuffs. Rations \ncomprised of the following: 70 kg of millet, 20 kg of rice, 15 kg of \nniebe and 6 litres of vegetable oil per household in Oudalan Province; \n60 kg of millet or sorghum, 30 kg of rice, 15 kg of niebe and 6 litres of \nvegetable oil in Soum and Yatenga provinces.  \n \nMali: Mali Red Cross distributed commodities provided by the World \nFood Programme (WFP). In total, 41,413 children, aged between 5 \nand 59 months, benefited from 1.491 MT of food.  \nThe Niger Red Cross distributes essential \nfood aid to villagers in Tigar. According to \nUN statistics, some 3.6 million of Niger\u2019s 12 \nmillion inhabitants were directly affected by \nthe food crisis. Mark Snelling/British Red \nCross. \n \n \n3\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nMali Red Cross, supported directly by the Federation, provided an additional 329 MT of food. Four distribution \nrounds were planned over 120 days and took place at 104 sites among 14 communes in Timbuktu, Goundam and \nGourma-Rharous. They targeted 10,226 children, of whom 4,036 were female. Rations were composed of 250 \ngrammes of enriched flour (CSB), 30 grammes of oil and 20 grammes of sugar per child per day.  \n \nNiger: The Federation completed its two rounds of general food distribution in Tillab\u00e9ri and Agadez provinces by \nmid-October 2005, in line with the onset of the year\u2019s harvest. An estimated 143,558 beneficiaries were reached and \nover 3.327 MT of foodstuffs distributed. \n \nGiven the immense distances involved both within and between distribution areas, two logistical hubs were \nestablished for each distribution centre \u2013 one in Filingu\u00e9 and one in Agadez. A dedicated group of Red Cross \nSociety of Niger volunteers were recruited and trained for the operation (130 in Tillab\u00e9ri and 50 in Agadez). The \nRed Cross teams worked in close cooperation with village heads and local leaders in identifying and confirming \nbeneficiaries.  \n \nImpact \nThe nutritional status of vulnerable families was markedly increased. It was estimated that calorie intake had been \nraised from 90 calories per person to 1,777 calories per person, which was within the accepted norm of 2,100 \ncalories per person. \n \nConstraints \nTargeting and initial estimates of numbers of beneficiaries for general food distributions were based on government \ncensus figures. As a result, beneficiary numbers were generally underestimated and members of semi-nomadic \ncommunities were not always included. Furthermore, relief teams identified a number of \u2018gap villages\u2019 with \nequivalent needs that had not been included in lists initially received. A degree of \u2018on-the-spot diplomacy\u2019 and \nflexibility ended up being demonstrated by Federation relief teams in allocating rations and adjusting second round \ndistributions in order to meet the needs of additional people vulnerable throughout a number of communities. \n \nThe distances and remote nature of many villages created logistical challenges and an increased workload for relief \ndistributions \u2013 in one case mules were used as a local means of transportation for general food distributions.  In \nBurkina Faso, the greatest constraints were distances between the capital, Ouagadougou, and main areas of \noperation, posing a challenge in purchasing, transport and general programme implementation. Distributions in \nareas such as Soum were complicated by the existence of large areas of swampy land following the rainy season, \nmaking access highly difficult. To counter the problem, distribution points were established in the nearest dry areas. \nAlthough new distribution points posed greater travelling distances for beneficiaries, they remained accessible by \ncart enabling the local population to still receive much needed food assistance in a fairly timely manner.   \n \nIn Mali, transport was challenging as some villages were not reachable by road; \u2018pinasses\u2019 or motorized pirogues \nwere, therefore, rented. Unfortunately, pinasses could not ensure totally secure transportation since some goods \ncould become wet and unusable and others could be lost overboard. Furthermore, the duration of distributions in \nMali was prolonged due to difficulties in the identification of children as many bear similar names.  In addition, due \nto migration habits, organizing distributions for nomadic populations was generally a challenge.  \n \nSpecific objective 2: (Health \u2013 supplementary feeding): Provide basic health services through emergency \nsupplementary feeding for targeted vulnerable children aged under five years, to a total population of 24,500 \nin Niger. \n \nAchievements \nRed Cross/Red Crescent supplementary feeding programmes were operational in Niger since 1 August 2005 in \ncooperation with the French Red Cross (who already had an established bilateral programme in Niger), the Qatari \nRed Crescent and the Spanish Red Cross in the regions of Tahoua, Maradi, Zinder, Tanout and Agadez. By the \nclose of September 2005, the government of Niger had a new protocol in place, establishing its responsibility for the \nnutritional situation in the country. By that time, the Federation was questioning the merits of a \u2018parallel system\u2019 of \na supplementary feeding being conducted by the international humanitarian community as a long-term venture. It \nbecame clear that the Federation, in partnership with the Red Cross Society of Niger needed to assist government \nregional authorities in making their health centre personnel more tangibly responsible for the management of \nmalnutrition. \n \n \n4\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nBy mid-January 2006, 48,525 moderately malnourished children had been treated through the Red Cross/Red \nCrescent supplementary feeding centres at Tahoua, Maradi, Zinder, Agadez-Arlit and Tanout. An additional 3,825 \nmoderately malnourished children were treated between February and September 2006. In addition to the treatment \nrations for malnourished children (UNIMIX), their families received protection rations, bringing the total number of \nbeneficiaries to 291,150. The protection rations were composed of 100 kg of cereals, 50 kg of beans and four litres \nof vegetable oil per month. This ration was halved after the harvest (end of October 2005), and was discontinued \ncompletely in December 2005.   \n \nConstraints  \nThe caseload of supplementary feeding centres was higher than \nexpected, putting additional strain and workload on Red Cross \nvolunteers \nand \ndelegates. \nThe \noverwhelming \nresponse \nto \nsupplementary feeding and the provision of family protection rations \n\u2013 the combination of a health programme and relief activity \u2013 posed \nchallenges for ensuring quality programming, adequate training and \nservice provision, general staff supervision and management.  \nNiger Red Cross Society volunteers weighing \na little child. According to the Niger Red \nCross, many children were moderately or \nseverely \nmalnourished \nin \nNiger. \nOlav \nSaltbones/Norwegian Red Cross. \n \nAnother main challenge for the supplementary feeding treatment \nprogramme was the prevalence of malaria and other endemic diseases \nin Niger. As a result, the health programme of the Qatari Red \nCrescent involved additional training and treatment for malaria as \npart of its supplementary feeding activities. Vaccination programmes \nwere also implemented at a number of the feeding centres. \n \nThe protection ratios that were being provided to families with \nmalnourished children were ultimately discontinued due to the \nfollowing reasons:  \n\u2022 \nAnecdotal evidence indicated that children were been kept \ndeliberately malnourished so that their families could receive \nthe rations;  \n\u2022 \nObservations by staff and volunteers showed that some \nmothers took their children to the health centres only when \nthere were distributions of family rations;  \n\u2022 \nSome women gave their children purgative plants to keep \nthem thin, thus eligible for the programme. \n \nSpecific objective 3 (relief \u2013 cash distribution): As per the Revised Plan of Action of 7 August 2005, a cash \ndistribution was foreseen targeting 20,000 beneficiaries, or 4,000 households, to communities in Niger and \nMali. \n \nAchievements \nAs of 18 November 2005, cash distributions were completed at Tanout assisting 34,278 beneficiaries (5,713 \nhouseholds) in 88 villages and three pastoralist settlements. One-time cash grants of XOF 120,000 (approximately \nUSD 240 or EUR 182), were provided to each household.  \n \nAs part of the cash project \u2013 and through a unique partnership between the Federation, British Red Cross, Swedish \nRed Cross and University of Arizona \u2013 a monitoring regime began in the aftermath of the distributions to assess \ntheir impact at household, village, market and regional levels. Quantitative and qualitative information gathering \nalso focused on the impact of cash distributions on the nutritional status of recipient and non-recipient households. \nThe report of the evaluation is available upon request.  \n \nIn summary (according to the Phase III evaluation report), households that received financial support from the Red \nCross/Red Crescent were less likely to be indebted (4.9 per cent compared to 25.3 per cent). Among indebted \nhouseholds, cash recipients were lesser in debt compared to those who did not receive cash (average amount to be \nrepaid XOF 24,514 for cash villages and XOF 64,625 for control villages). These findings support reports from \n \n \n5\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nPhase I and II evaluations, which indicated that households used financial resources from the Red Cross cash \ndistribution to pay off loans and reduce indebtedness. The reports are available upon request. \n \nImpact \nAssistance was provided to 5,713 vulnerable families at a critical juncture in the yearly cycle, by providing them \nwith the means to manage their immediate economic needs and reestablish their households on a more secure \nfinancial footing.  \n \nConstraints \nOpposition to cash distribution by some non-governmental and international organizations, coupled with unclear \nsupport from the authorities, led to a degree of confusion that came close to derailing the project. A last-minute \nmessage received from the Governor of Zinder, conveyed through the Head of the CCA (who is responsible to the \nCabinet and Office of the Prime Minister), temporarily suspended cash distributions just prior to the scheduled start \nof the project. Following extensive negotiations, a formal agreement with the government was reached, sanctioned \nby the President of Niger, with full support from the Red Cross Society of Niger. \n \nLack of banking facilities in Tanout and surrounding remote villages led to some logistical and security challenges. \nHowever, these were successfully addressed and the project progressed well. \n \nSpecific objective 4 (Logistics, administration and telecoms): Immediately augment the existing Red Cross \nand Red Crescent National Societies with logistical, administrative and telecommunications infrastructure in \nthe four different countries of the Sahel operation. \n \nAchievements \n \nIT/Telecoms: The Mali Red Cross benefited from the presence of an IT/Telecoms delegate during the first six \nmonths of the Sahel operation when the main installations were done. The Sahel operation IT/Telecoms team \ninstalled a wide area network/local area network (WAN/LAN) with an access point and Internet connection for \napproximately 15 users. A counterpart from the National Society was recruited and trained; before leaving Mali, the \nSahel operation IT/Telecom team handed over to the IT/telecom counterpart who would ensure proper maintenance \nof the equipment, with support from the team in Niamey. A total of five laptops and three radios were provided by \nthe British Red Cross and two new desktops, one network printer and radios by the Federation.  \n \nIn Mauritania, the Federation installed three high frequency (HF) and very high frequency (VHF) bases in Zoucrete, \nNouakchott and Nema/Nouadibhou, and two mobile HF and VHF units (with 15 handsets), in response to \npopulation movements.   \n \nIn Burkina Faso, the British Red Cross provided the Burkinabe Faso \nRed Cross Society with four laptops, two Thuraya satellite phones as \nwell as HF and VHF equipment in two vehicles.  \n \nIn addition to IT/telecom bases that already existed in Niger, the \nFederation provided the Red Cross Society of Niger with one laptop, \ntwo desktops, one network printer, two HF and VHF bases for Niamey \nand Tahoua as well as two HF and VHF mobiles and 15 handsets. An \nIT/telecom counterpart was recruited and trained, and an Internet \nconnection was provided. \n \nLogistics: Overall, logistics of the operation functioned well, despite \nsome under-staffing and staff change challenges. The fleet in Niger \nran at full capacity, with 31 Federation vehicles and 11 rental vehicles \ncovering over 200,000 km a month, often over difficult terrain. The \noperation in Mali was also a logistical success, as commodities were delivered to a much dispersed set of \nbeneficiaries, also over very challenging terrains.   \nInternational Federation officials preparing \nTSU trucks for food distributions in Niger. \nOlav Saltbones/Norwegian Red Cross. \n \n \n \n6\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \n                                                \nFor the distributions that were undertaken in Burkina Faso, 333.5 MT of rice, sorghum and oil were transported \nfrom the Red Cross Society of Niger/Federation/Transport Support Unit (TSU) warehouse in Niamey to the various \ndistribution sites. Two Federation logisticians were dispatched from Niger to support the relief delegate and the \nBurkinabe Red Cross Society to complete the distributions and to assess the National Society\u2019s capacities.  \n \nIn Filingue-Abala (Niger), as part of food-for-work activities, a sub-office and warehouse were temporarily \nestablished at Abala.  Ten Transport Support Unit trucks were dispatched as part of the food-for-work effort, and a \nstock of 200 MT of cereals was put in place. TSU operational hubs were based in Tahoua and Maradi, with \napproximately 20 trucks in each location and 30 trucks remaining in Niamey.  \n \nLogistics training in Niamey was completed, with similar training (for about 10 people per session for 3 days) \nundertaken in Zinder, Agadez, Tillabery, Tahoua and Maradi. The warehouse and compound of the Red Cross \nSociety of Niger were also renovated to include a new entry zone, an improved grading to protect the area against \nground water and rains as well as new roofing. \n \nApart from supporting the Federation and other Red Cross/Red Crescent activities, the TSU supported WFP \ncooperating partners such as Action Against Hunger (ACF 2), Concern and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) \nthrough \u2018cluster deployments\u2019 of up to ten trucks.  \n \nImpact \nThe logistics team supported Federation operations and Partner National Society programmes, concentrating its \nactivities on the general food distributions and supplementary feeding programmes. Though the enormous distances \nthat had to be covered (compounded by an often unreliable supply chain) posed some challenges, beneficiary needs \nwere met in a timely and regular manner. \n \nConstraints \nIn Burkina Faso, internal and external communications were hampered by a lack of equipment, difficult and \nunreliable connections and a lack of available technical personnel to pursue implementation of IT/telecoms activities. \n \nThe long distances involved in transporting goods across the region, the quality of the transport infrastructure and \nweather conditions at certain times, compounded by an unreliable supply chain, posed challenges for operational \nlogistics. Despite the constraints, the Federation possessed a dynamic logistics team able to overcome obstacles so \nthat beneficiary demands could be met in a timely and regular manner.   \n \nAmong logistical challenges, one difficulty was the imposition by the Government of Niger on limits of tonnage for \ntrucks passing through Niamey. Shipments for a number of organizations, most notably the Federation, WFP and \nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), were blocked in transit due to the new regulations which levied fines of \nXOF 10,000 per metric tonne on cargo exceeding 25 metric tonnes. In response, the Federation sought and received \na temporary exemption for its food commodities that were already en route. \n \nThe receipt of food commodities was a complicated process since limited information tended to be provided by \nfreight forwarders regarding expected delivery times. Discussions with freight forwarders on behalf of Sahel \nOperation staff improved the situation, resulting in the ultimate receipt of all goods.  \n \nSpecific objective 5 (Relief - livestock interventions for Mali and Niger): As per the Revised Plan of Action of \n7 August 2005, it was anticipated that 5,000 pastoralists would be assisted in Mali and Niger.   \n \nAchievements  \nThe food distributions also provided the opportunity to undertake parallel activities in the area of livestock health \nand support. On 11 November 2005, livestock vaccination sensitization campaigns started in different villages in the \nSalam Region, in cooperation with the Malian Ministry of Livestock. Radio stations broadcasted campaign \ninformation in four local languages and heads of villages were contacted as part of the sensitization process.   \n \n \n2 In French: Action Contre la Faim \n \n \n7\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \n                                                \nIn turn, 15,897 heads of livestock were vaccinated in Salam and Gourma Rharous. The number of cattle attended to \nwas well above the original target of 10,000, despite reticence amongst pastoralists in identifying exact numbers of \ncattle due to taxation implications.  \n \nIn December 2005 and January 2006, two rounds of fodder distributions were undertaken in the Salam Region. \nTheir purpose was to ensure livestock fodder consumption, prevent livestock sales on the markets and guarantee \nfodder in cold periods. There were two main breeder selection criteria; at least one malnourished child in the \nhousehold and breeders had to own between 10 and 50 livestock heads. Roughly 10,400 livestock heads benefited \nfrom fodder distributions totalling 180 MT. \n \nImpact \nReinforcing vulnerable livestock, thereby enabling on-going viability of pastoralist communities through a livestock \nvaccination programme and the distribution of fodder, enabled them to build up their livestock capacity so as to \nsurvive the extreme temperatures period that begins in December. \n \nSpecific objective 6 (Relief - cereal bank support for Mali and Niger): As per the Revised Plan of Action of 7 \nAugust 2005, it was anticipated that food stocks could be placed at cereal banks in 250 of the worst affected \ncommunities in Mali and Niger. \n \nAchievements \nAs monitoring progressed, it became evident that cereal banks could be a means of further assisting people affected \nby drought in Niger. Preliminary investigations suggested that as many as 50 villages could benefit from cereal \nbanks as a means of enhancing their longer-term food security.   \n \nA project manager from the British Red Cross arrived in Niger to develop a pilot cereal bank project, along with \nacademic staff from the University of Arizona. In addition to the funding provided by the British Red Cross, the \nFederation agreed to provide logistics support for the research and implementation phases of the pilot project.  \n \nVillage lands were identified, sites were confirmed using the Global Positioning System (GPS) and official \ndocuments were signed by village chiefs who authorized allocation of the land. A total of 21 cereal banks were \nconstructed in villages around Tanout; construction was completed in July, 2006, before the onset of the rainy \nseason. The banks were built using cement bricks, concrete and steel. The rationale for using these materials to \nbuild the cereal banks, instead of local traditional materials, was based on research done (reflecting on the use of \nboth types of products) with an important factor being the reduction of overhead costs, thus contributing to longer-\nterm sustainability. \n \nTwenty one village committees for cereal bank management were created and a three-day management training was \nconducted. Several items, including tables, chairs, notebooks, pens and cleaning products for the cereal banks, were \nprovided. Since the cereal banks began operating during the lean season, rice sales started immediately after \nconstruction was completed and management committees were in place.   \n \nAccording to the original design, households were required to pay a XOF 500 membership fee in order to purchase \ncereals3 from the banks. In Farak, 200 households were active in the cereal banks, with each household eligible to \npurchase up to five tias per week.  Funds collected from the sales were to be kept until after the harvest, when prices \ndropped significantly and more cereals could be purchased for use in the next lean season. \n \nConstraints \nDue to the requirement to pay membership fees, it was found out that 30 per cent of households were not accessing \nfood in the banks by July 2006. Management committees were primarily comprised of men, and it was not possible \nto ascertain whether the most vulnerable households were represented in the committees. Given that literacy and \nnumeracy skills were some of the criteria used to select members of the committee, it is likely that the most \nvulnerable households were not represented. In Farak, CARE had been working for two years, providing support to \n \n3 During a post-operation evaluation of the project, a meeting with women in Farak village revealed that they were paying XOF \n850 per tia of rice in the banks, compared to XOF 1,100 in the market.    \n \n \n8\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \n                                                \nwomen\u2019s village banks. The skills gained by the women in managing cereal banks could have been capitalized upon \nin setting up the management committee for the Red Cross-supported cereal banks. Women, who had proven their \nability to manage the savings of village banks and had gained the trust of their members, could have formed the \nmanagement committees. The Red Cross has realized this and in future, such interventions shall take into \nconsideration available skills and gender balance. \n \nSpecific objective 7 (Health \u2013 post-emergency health for Niger): Sustainable health interventions to promote \nresilience and improve the longer-term health of the most vulnerable are advocated.   \n \nAchievements \n \nMalnutrition strategy \nAs part of the technical support-transition process for the integrated health centres (CSI)4, and on behalf of the \nFederation and the Red Cross Society of Niger, 60 health officers and 30 general staff were trained in malnutrition \nscreening and treatment (according to the national protocol), and supplementary feeding stock management. The \ntraining and integration of services was undertaken in 15 health centres, including Hadachimo, Mogheur, Dangona, \nMaboya, Ill\u00e9la, Bagaroua, S\u00e9hia, T\u00e9baram, Toulou, Edir, Dandoutchi, Taja\u00e9, Dandaji and Moull\u00e9la. As part of the \nintegration strategy, the Federation trained 40 Red Cross Society of Niger volunteers who will continue providing \ntechnical support to community health centres.  \n \nBecause chronic malnutrition is a result of specific behaviours towards food and hygiene, the main focus of the \nSahel operation health team at Tahoua was educating key people (matrons within communities and Red Cross \nSociety of Niger volunteers) as agents who would sensitize and mobilize the local populations. To this end, 60 \nmatrons and 40 Red Cross Society of Niger volunteers working with the CSI in Tahoua and Ill\u00e9la districts were \ntrained in nutrition information, education and communication (IEC).  \n \nMatrons were considered key people as they are usually the traditional advisers of mothers on children\u2019s health \nissues within communities. Training sessions for matrons typically lasted two days while for volunteers took one \nday. A training of trainers (ToT) session for Red Cross Society of Niger counterparts in nutrition and education was \nalso undertaken through the health programme in Tahoua. In addition, 150 training sessions on nutrition followed in \nJuly 2006.  \n \nMobile health \nFollowing a pilot mobile health team project initiated in October 2005 in the Tahoua area, a Memorandum of \nUnderstanding was entered into with the regional health authorities for on-going delivery of much needed basic \nhealth care to remote communities that lacked access to basic health services.  \n \nIn November 2005, three mobile clinics were set up in Tahoua, with five trained volunteers in each. They visited 48 \ndifferent sites (120 villages in three different health districts), often together with the major (nurse) from the nearest \nhealth centre. During the visits, they vaccinated children aged under five years, made prenatal and post natal \nconsultations, sensitized women on basic health issues, conducted malnutrition screening, and provided de-worming \nmedication.  \n \nBetween March and August 2006, 9,888 children had been vaccinated and 1,906 de-wormed. The vaccination \ncoverage in the region where the clinics were operating was more than 90 per cent. 2,674 prenatal consultations \nwere held where women were vaccinated, and 3,731 malnourished children were identified and sent to malnutrition \ncentres. About 8,196 women were reached with messages/information on breastfeeding issues, weaning, diarrhoea, \nvaccination of new-borns, malaria, use of mosquito nets, food-environmental-and body hygiene, and family \nplanning. \n \nImpact \nThe mobile health teams contributed to the improvement of access to primary health in the Tahoua region. Due to \nimproved access, the vaccination coverage amongst children under 11 months was increased in the region and in \nother areas of operation under the supplementary feeding programmes. \n \n \n4 In French: Centre de Sant\u00e9 Int\u00e9gr\u00e9 (CSI) \n \n \n9\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nConstraint \nDistances to these remote villages were great, sometimes between 150 and 230 km, and road access was non-\nexistent.  \n \nSpecific objective 8: Water and sanitation (WatSan), Niger \n \nAchievements \nFollowing an assessment mission undertaken in September 2005, a number of potential water and sanitation \nactivities were outlined that were to be implemented immediately or over the mid-term and longer-term. Among the \nactivities were the following: construction and rehabilitation of well; construction and rehabilitation of school \nlatrines; and construction and rehabilitation of family latrines. With assistance from the Swedish Red Cross, \nimplementation of WatSan activities began. The programme was later scaled up with financial support from the \nQatari Red Crescent and it is being implemented after the close of the Sahel operation.  \n \nEighty volunteers from the Red Cross Society of Niger were trained in Participatory Hygiene and Sanitation \nTransformation (PHAST), a methodology that builds on people\u2019s innate ability to address and resolve their own \nproblems. In turn, the Red Cross volunteers trained community-based volunteers in the targeted villages; the Red \nCross volunteers were equipped with motorbikes to facilitate easy reach (five villages per volunteer). More than 70 \nof these volunteers conducted sensitization activities in 235 villages of Tahoua, Tillabery and Zinder. In Tahoua and \nin Filingu\u00e9, 110 water management committees have been formed and their members trained. The committees are \nnow responsible for managing the wells constructed/rehabilitated under the project. Similar committees will be \nestablished in Zinder. The WatSan activities will continue until end of July 2007. \n \nImpact \nHygiene promotion, using the PHAST methodology, in Tahoua contributed towards cholera prevention \u2013 in 2006 \u2013 \nin areas where cholera is endemic, such as in Bouza.   \n \nConstraints \nAt the beginning, implementation of activities was slow because there were no community-based volunteers in the \ntargeted villages. Due to delays in implementation, water and sanitation activities should continue for two years to \nassure the ownership of the infrastructure by the beneficiaries. \n \nSpecific objective 9: Logistics \u2013 capacity building  \n \nAchievements \nDifferent trainings were provided to the Red Cross Society of Niger volunteers and staff. The sessions include a \ntraining that was held in Niamey for 15 members of the governance and executive branches of the National Society. \nThe five-day workshop covered issues such as project planning, logistics, preparedness and response, procurement, \nwarehousing and transport management as well as IT/telecommunications. During the last day of training, a visit to \nthe National Society\u2019s warehouse and a brainstorming session were undertaken about the future of logistics within \nthe Red Cross Society of Niger. Three days of training were also held for volunteers and staff members in Zinder, \nAgadez, Tillabery, Tahoua and Maradi.  \n \nAn emergency stock of 1,000 MT of cereals was pre-positioned for the Red Cross Society of Niger at its Niamey \nwarehouse. The emergency stock was treated as per Federation standards, with National Society staff members \ntrained in warehousing techniques. In the framework of the general logistics training, a specific module on \nwarehousing was provided. At the Red Cross Society of Niger Tahoua base, a logistics counterpart was fully \nintegrated into Federation activities.   \n \nSpecific objective 10: Relief-livelihoods capacity building in Niger. \n \nAchievements \n \nLivelihoods small grants programme \nThe small grants project was implemented by the Irish Red Cross in Agadez and divided into two parts; family \ngrants and collective grants for micro-projects. Family grants were meant to assist vulnerable families until the next \nrainy season and reinforce their coping mechanisms in future by contributing to replenishment of their household \n \n \n10\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \neconomy. Collective grants for micro-projects were oriented towards reinforcement of food security of local \ncommunities.  \n \nAfter a series of surveys and assessments, the Irish Red Cross, as the manager of the activity, decided to provide \ngrants to ten per cent of the vulnerable populations in each village (people aged over 60 years, and \npregnant/lactating women). Focus groups, with women, revealed that small animals were considered the highest \npriority to improve livelihood security; some women identified food as their greatest need while others indicated the \nneed for alternative sources of income, such as weaving palm frond for sale in the local market.  \nAccordingly, the Red Cross implemented a programme where staff, with support from branch volunteers, purchased \nsmall ruminants (sheep and goats) in bulk for distribution to targeted households. Beneficiaries participated in \nassessing the general health of the animals before they were purchased. Cereals were also purchased in bulk and \ngiven to extremely vulnerable households, based on family size. Finally, palm fronds were provided directly to \nwomen to make mats, and the Red Cross volunteers assisted in marketing.  This programme ended in August 2006. \n \nFood-for-work projects: In Mali, in addition to relief food distributions, \u2018food for work\u2019 and \u2018food-for-training\u2019 \nprogrammes were implemented up to end of November 2005. \u2018Food-for-work\u2019 and \u2018food-for-training\u2019 distributions \nwere made at the beginning and the end of the work/training sessions, and they aimed at protecting the child rations \nalready distributed. Among the food-for-work projects were dyke construction, reforestation, water pipe \nconstruction, irrigation, warehouse construction and market gardening.  \n \nFood-for-training projects were mainly oriented towards HIV/AIDS sensitization, elimination of illiteracy and \nnutrition education. Beneficiaries received 2 kg of cereals and 75 grammes of oil per day when participating in a \nfood-for-work project and 1.2 kg of cereals and 45 grammes of oil per day when participating in a training session. \n \nIn Niger, following an initial assessment and discussions with community members on the most important needs at \nthe community level, food-for-work projects were designed and implemented in Agadez, in Filingue-Abala, and in \nTahoua.   \n \nA pilot project was undertaken in Fadama and Tillimoune, two villages north of Abala and close to the Mali border. \nActivities in both villages focused on provision of water and agriculture. They included: \n\u2022 \nSoil recuperation and improvement of a water catchment in Fadama and Tillimoune; \n\u2022 \nRehabilitation of a community well in Fadama and Tillimoune. \n \nBy July 2006, 1,113 workers had benefited from the food-for-work projects in Tillimoune and Fadama. In \nTillimoune, the projects included well rehabilitation and soil rehabilitation (through construction of half moons), \nconstruction of stone walls and planting trees. Rehabilitation of wells was completed, and 2,630 forest half moons, \n5,008 agricultural half-moons and 4.16 km of stone lines were installed. More than 6,000 trees were planted. In \nFadama, in addition to soil rehabilitation, there were three additional projects; one to deepen a pond (to make it a \nyear-round catchment area), the second to build four micro-dams (to slow down water flow so that water would \nfilter down to the water table), and the third to rehabilitate a deep well. All projects were identified by communities. \nWell reconstruction and the four micro-dams were completed.  \n \nIn Tahoua, four food-for-work projects were conducted to recuperate 80 hectares of land through the construction of \nhalf-moons and planting acacia trees. A total of 23,710 half-moons were dug, and 5,200 acacia trees were planted.  \nA rotation system for teams of workers was established so that each team would work for one day out of three, \nleaving the other two days available for working in their fields. At least 719 persons, including 77 branch volunteers \nand 10 technical specialists, worked in the projects and received sufficient food to meet their family needs for one \nmonth.    \n \nImpact \nThe assistance provided to 5,713 vulnerable families at a critical juncture in the yearly cycle, helped them with the \nmeans to manage their immediate economic needs and re-establish their households on a more secure financial \nfooting.  \n \n \n \n11\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nThe relatively substantial cash grant provided vulnerable households with a choice in coping mechanisms. \nEvaluation reports indicate that families that benefited from small grants used the funds to buy foodstuffs, cattle and \nnecessary household implements, such as carts, and to pay off debts. This showed that households prioritized \ninvesting in their longer-term economic viability over shorter-term needs. \n \nHouseholds were not constrained to pay off debts by selling their harvest at a loss. Cash-in-hand enabled agro-\npastoralist communities to decide when to buy and when to sell, thereby ensuring better management of their \nharvest and livestock. It also enabled stockpiling of millet, to help families apportion their harvest to last them \nthrough the lean period, which soon followed.  \n \nConstraints \nUnfortunately, one of the dams constructed in Fadama did not hold, and there was insufficient time remaining in the \nproject to rehabilitate the dam. In addition, trees were not planted as expected and the Red Cross eventually gave \n2,000 of the trees to the Department of the Environment for planting elsewhere. \n \nSpecific objective 11 (Reporting-media-communications \u2013 advocacy and public information): Promote and \ndisseminate within the target audience the activities highlighted in the Supplementary Plan of Action \u2013 \nAppeal Extension and overall Sahel operation.    \n \nAchievements  \nThroughout the operation, the Federation information delegate held regular interviews with international, local and \nregional media. The delegate also accompanied camera teams to the field, and briefed journalists interested in the \nrelief operation as well as communication teams of Partner National Societies. In addition, key documents, \nphotographs and fact sheets were developed and shared with partners, stakeholders and national societies interested \nand/or involved in the operation. Articles were published on the Federation\u2019s website and a dedicated section \nfocusing on the Sahel food crisis was created.  \n \nContinuous training was provided to the Federation regional information officer, in Dakar, on the professional role \nforeseen within the Federation, focusing on information-gathering during disasters and reporting. This aimed at \nensuring continuity of highlighting forgotten disasters once the operation closed. In addition, documents on \ninformation management during disasters \u2013 produced by the Inter-Americas Communicators Network \u2013 were shared \nwith the Red Cross Society of Niger press officer.  \n \nTraining packages on promotion of Humanitarian Values and Red Cross principles, including information on the \nCode of Conduct of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief, were given to \nFederation staff and Partner National Societies working in the Sahel operation (in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger). \nThe aim was to reinforce knowledge of Red Cross principles and values among the volunteers involved in the food-\ncrisis operation, especially newcomers. \n \nCoordination \n \nWithin the Red Cross/Red Crescent Movement \nCoordination and cooperation within logistics, human resources and programme support was established between \nthe Federation and Participating National Societies, in particular the French Red Cross, the Irish Red Cross, the \nQatari Red Crescent, the Saudi Arabian Red Crescent and the Spanish Red Cross. As the Sahel operation developed, \ncontact was also established with the Iranian Red Crescent as it has a long-standing and noteworthy presence in \nNiger.  \n \nThe Federation regional delegation in Dakar facilitated and coordinated the deployment of Regional Disaster \nResponse Team (RDRT) members from West Africa. Staff provided by the National Societies of Algeria, Benin, \nCameroon, Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Nigeria and Togo played a crucial role since the \nearliest stages of the operation. Their involvement was pivotal for the development, implementation and success of \nvarious activities. It signalled the reliable expertise available throughout different countries in the region.   \n \nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) provided regular security updates. ICRC also provided \ntraining for volunteers from the Red Cross Society of Niger, in Tahoua.  \n \n \n12\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nWith beneficiaries \nAt the local and regional-country level, relief and supplementary feeding activities were undertaken in collaboration \nwith local and provincial authorities to facilitate coordination while underlining and ensuring respect for \nFundamental Principles of the Red Cross Movement. Heads of villages were, in particular, closely linked to the Red \nCross/Red Crescent response due to their pivotal role within communities.   \n \nWith government agencies \nAn effective working relationship was established with the main governmental bodies involved in the crisis \u2013 such \nas Cellule de Crise Alimentaire (CCA) and Syst\u00e8me d\u2019Alerte Pr\u00e9coce (SAP) \u2013 and with key government of Niger \nministries, in cooperation with the Red Cross Society of Niger. The ministries included the Ministry of Health and \nthe Ministry of Community Development.  In Tahoua (Niger), the Red Cross/Red Crescent worked very closely \nwith regional government health staff. This facilitated competency development and the eventual transfer of \nsupplementary feeding centres to the government.    \n \nWith other agencies \nSince the onset of the Sahel operation, the Federation collaborated closely with United Nations agencies \n(particularly in the organization of transport services and provision of food assistance), and the broader \nhumanitarian community, most notably in the health sector.   \n \nThe operation had a series of partnerships, which enabled the Red Cross/Red Crescent to draw on other forms of \nexpertise, as well as additional financial resources to support the activities. Collegial support for various Federation \nactivities was received from organizations such as Concern, GOAL, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), Oxfam and \nSave the Children-UK.   \n \nThrough the Transport Support Unit (TSU), the Federation developed relationships with WFP and its implementing \npartners. Greater numbers of beneficiaries were assisted on a timely basis through food distribution and food-for-\nwork than would have been possible had the TSU not been established.   \n \nThe Spanish Red Cross in Maradi had an agreement with MSF-France, where severely malnourished children \nwould be referred to MSF for treatment, and moderately malnourished children seeking assistance at MSF clinics \nwould be referred to Red Cross clinics for treatment.   \n \nThe British Red Cross contracted the services of the University of Arizona to monitor the impact of the cash \ndistribution project in Tanout. This had the effect of bringing in highly qualified experts who provided objectivity in \nmonitoring data and impact. \n \nConcern referred children (when they have reached 80 per cent of their weight) from its acute malnutrition feed \ncentres to the Red Cross/Red Crescent. Concern invested considerable time to ensure that its supplementary feeding \nactivities did not overlap those of the Red Cross.   \n \nNational Society Capacity Building \nIn general, all sectors of the intervention contained elements for training and support of volunteers and staff of Host \nNational Societies. Among the various aspects of the Sahel operation, a network of more than 360 volunteers was \ntrained as part of the initial emergency response in the areas of relief, health care, logistics, administration, \ntelecommunications, reporting and media relations. In a relatively short time, their knowledge of the Red Cross/Red \nCrescent Movement was greatly enhanced. As key players in an operational partnership, volunteers and staff \nconsistently showed their dedication and skills.     \n \nThe counterpart system was very successful, especially in supplementary feeding centres, mobile health clinics, \ncommunity health, water and sanitation, and food-for-work. In all these sectors, activities were implemented using \ncounterparts from local Red Cross branches.   \n \nTraining of Burkinabe Red Cross Society volunteers in registration and distribution procedures was undertaken in \nconjunction with its first aid section. In each province of Burkina Faso, a team of 30 volunteers supported by a \nsupervisor, team leader and logistician was established. Volunteers were then deployed to the various target areas or \n\u2018d\u00e9partements\u2019 within the province and the supervisor/team leader continued to work alongside the volunteers. \n \n \n13\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nWith support from the operation, the Tahoua branch of the Red Cross Society of Niger rehabilitated its offices, \nincreased its professional competency and strengthened its financial management capability. A number of \nvolunteers were trained and they in turn provided support to local health centres and other key community health \nactivities. The branch also developed its logistics capacity to provide necessary support, when needed, in Tahoua. \n \nMonitoring and evaluation \nWith a variety of Movement actors continuing their presence in Niger following the closure of the operation, a \nfocused evaluation was commissioned by the Federation to review efforts undertaken under the Sahel Operation. \nThe evaluation particularly emphasized on Niger (which was the most affected country, and where the operation \nreally focused on), to help determine how the remaining actors can capitalize on their presence, interests and \nstrengths in reflection of continuing needs in the country.  \n \nThe evaluation focused on three thematic areas: appropriateness of the disaster response intervention; processes; \nand relationships. The findings indicate that through the Sahel operation, the Red Cross/Red Crescent contributed to \nthe reduction of the short-term effects of the drought. The Red Cross/Red Crescent intervention helped to reduce \nfood insecurity and addressed the needs of moderately malnourished children, among others. \n \nFor further information specifically related to this operation please contact: \n\u2022 \nIn Dakar: Alasan Senghore, Federation Head of Zone for West and Central Africa, Dakar; email: \nalasan.senghore@ifrc.org; telephone +221.869.36.41; fax +221.860.20.02. \n \nAll International Federation assistance seeks to adhere to the Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and \nRed Crescent Movement and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO's) in Disaster Relief and is committed to the \nHumanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards in Disaster Response (Sphere) in delivering assistance to the most \nvulnerable. \n \nFor longer-term programmes in this or other countries or regions, please refer to the Federation\u2019s Annual Appeal. \nFor support to or for further information concerning Federation programmes or operations in this or other \ncountries, or for national society profiles, please also access the Federation\u2019s website at http://www.ifrc.org\n \n \n<Final financial report below; click here to return to the title page> \n \n \n14\nSelected Parameters\nReporting Timeframe\n2005/4-2007/8\nBudget Timeframe\n2005/4-2007/8\nAppeal\nM05EA015\nBudget\nAPPEAL\nAll figures are in Swiss Francs (CHF)\nFinal Financial Report\nM05EA015 - BURKINA FASO, MALI, MAURITANIA & NIGER: FOOD INSEC\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies\nI.

This situation resulted in a severe food crisis and heightened malnutrition in many \nlocations of Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger. Niger was, however, the most affected country.  \n \nAs part of its overall stewardship for West Africa, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent \nSocieties regional delegation in Dakar closely monitored the situation. Through several assessment and support \nmissions to the concerned countries, the delegation assisted National Societies in disseminating warnings of \nupcoming food insecurity to affected communities as well as governments, national and international organizations.  \n \nAs the food security situation became increasingly alarming, the \nregional delegation deployed a three-member team comprising one \nconsultant and two Regional Disaster Response Team (RDRT) \nmembers to carry out a detailed assessment of the food security \nsituation in Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali and Mauritania and to assist \nthe National Societies in identifying their role in addressing the issue \nconsidering \ntheir \nexperience \nand \noperational \ncapacities. \nIn \ncoordination with the UN Office for the Coordination of \nHumanitarian Affairs (OCHA), World Food Programme (WFP), the \nUN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), other organizations \nand governments, the team developed recommendations for the \nFederation on ways of providing support to National Societies in the \nregion and possible interventions. Based on the findings of the \nassessments and information collected through secondary sources, the \nmain justifications for an emergency intervention were as follows: \nVillagers in drought-hit Tigar, Niger, gather \nfor a Red Cross food distribution. A \ncombination of drought and a locust invasion \nleft many parts of the Sahel region \ndesperately \nshort \nof \nfood. \nMark \nSnelling/British Red Cross. \n\u2022 \nLoss of life: There was increasing evidence from M\u00e9decins Sans \nFronti\u00e8res (MSF) and other sources that children were dying \u2013 \nparticularly in Niger \u2013 as a result of the crisis in the Sahel region;    \n\u2022 \nFood and health loss: Agricultural production in Niger during 2004 was severely affected by the locust invasion \nand drought.  Estimates from an assessment mission by the government, WFP, Famine Early Warning System \nNetwork (FEWS NET) and the Permanent Inter-State Committee on Drought Control (CILSS1) in March 2005 \nconcluded that 2.5 million people \u2013 approximately 20 percent of Niger\u2019s population \u2013 were food insecure and \nrequired food assistance.  The loss in cereal production was approximately 15 per cent compared to the average \nannual production over the last five years, or a grain deficit of about 225,000 metric tonnes (MT) for the year \n2005. While Mali, Burkina Faso and Mauritania were not as severely affected, they were still part of the same \ndisaster situation and needed support to discourage a further deterioration of the situation;     \n\u2022 \nLivestock loss: Livestock \u2013 particularly cattle, horses and donkeys that were least resistant to drought \u2013 were \nseverely affected by fodder shortages. Many dead carcasses were visible throughout the hardest hit parts of \nNiger and Mali.  Dakoro, Filingu\u00e9 and Ouallam were among the worst affected zones.  While no epidemics \nwere reported  (only food deficiencies and parasites) it was noted that coping capacities appeared to be stretched \nto the limit by continuing high cereal prices that translated into poor terms of trade in the selling livestock to \nbuy cereals; \n\u2022 \nEmployment loss: Because of food insecurity, many people were migrating in increasing numbers to larger \npopulation centres in search of employment or means to gain money. Population movement was considered a \nnegative indicator as it could have a detrimental impact on families, communities and security. \n \nOn 22 July 2005, the International Federation launched an Emergency Appeal seeking CHF 18,243,483 to assist \n44,400 households over a period of six months. While the Federation Emergency Appeal put forth immediate \nresponse efforts, those longer-term in nature were left for further definition pending programme support, general \nactivity progress and evolution of the crisis at hand.  After initial emergency response efforts and with the structural \nnature of the crisis in Niger and other affected countries becoming clearer, it became apparent that the initial six-\nmonth timeframe incorporating emergency, post-crisis and developmental activities was too tight. By mid-January \n2006, activities undertaken as part of the emergency appeal had reached 644,525 people (beyond the revised target \n \n1 In French: Comit\u00e9 Inter-Etate pour la Lutte contre la S\u00e9cheresse au Sahel \n \n \n2\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nof 536,000 beneficiaries), mainly due to a high response to supplementary feeding for malnourished children and \ntheir families. The appeal was subsequently revised; the number of targeted people was increased to 76,571 families \n(536,000 beneficiaries) and the timeframe was extended until end of July 2006. In line with these changes, the \nAppeal budget was increased to CHF 31,242,371 (USD 24,051,094 or EUR 19,798,714) on 13 April 2006.  \n \nAmong the various programmes of the Sahel operation, principal beneficiaries included moderately malnourished \nchildren and their families, households suffering from severe food shortages, the elderly, the ill, orphans and \ndisadvantaged pastoralist communities. Through the Red Cross/Red Crescent intervention, the assisted populations \nbenefited from sensitization and education campaigns as well as community projects such as food-for-work, \nbuilding and repair of wells, health, nutrition and hygiene training, skill enhancement and professional \ndevelopment. \n \nThis operation was effectively planned and managed, and achieved clear impact. Based on the initial success in \ndelivering the intended assistance, initiatives were undertaken to implement plans previously outlined in the appeal, \nwith a reasonable expectation that donors would support the activities and meet their obligations accordingly. \nUnfortunately, the anticipated funding support did not materialize, but the Federation had already engaged and \ncommitted with the National Societies and other partners. As a result, the operation was faced with a considerable \ndeficit (see attached final financial report). While this may raise valid questions over financial management and \ndiscipline, the Federation will resolve the situation transparently, working with the concerned National Societies. \nFor further questions related to this issue, please refer to the list of <contact details> provided at the end of this \nreport. \n \nAnalysis of the operation - objectives, achievements and impact \n \nGoal: Provide support to the affected Red Cross and Red Crescent national societies in order to decrease and \nfurther prevent vulnerability to food insecurity and malnutrition by immediately responding in the form of \nlivelihood interventions for 76,571 households (536,000 beneficiaries) over a six-month period. [As per the \nRevised Plan of Action of 7 August 2005]. \n \nSpecific objective 1 (Relief - general food distributions): Distribute a monthly general food ration to 76,571 \nhouseholds (536,000 people) in Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger.   \n \nAchievements \n \nBurkina Faso: Food distributions in the Northern provinces of Burkina Faso were completed by the end of April \n2006. However, following a field visit undertaken by the Federation, Burkinabe Red Cross Society and the \nLuxembourg Red Cross in Yatenga, Loroum and Soum provinces in December 2005, it was found that the northern \nregions still experienced severe effects of the drought as well as \nattacks by caterpillars and seed-eating birds. In some areas, food \nstocks could potentially last only two months since some producers \nwere already eating their new crop while they harvested. The \nassessment mission concluded that distributions needed to be \ncontinued in these areas, especially Oudalan, Soum, Yatenga, Loroum, \nSoum and Oudalan provinces.  \n \nConsequently, a supplementary round of distributions was done in \nSoum, Oudalan and Yatenga, reaching 19 sites and 8,984 households \nwith approximately 998 metric tonnes (MT) of foodstuffs. Rations \ncomprised of the following: 70 kg of millet, 20 kg of rice, 15 kg of \nniebe and 6 litres of vegetable oil per household in Oudalan Province; \n60 kg of millet or sorghum, 30 kg of rice, 15 kg of niebe and 6 litres of \nvegetable oil in Soum and Yatenga provinces.  \n \nMali: Mali Red Cross distributed commodities provided by the World \nFood Programme (WFP). In total, 41,413 children, aged between 5 \nand 59 months, benefited from 1.491 MT of food.  \nThe Niger Red Cross distributes essential \nfood aid to villagers in Tigar. According to \nUN statistics, some 3.6 million of Niger\u2019s 12 \nmillion inhabitants were directly affected by \nthe food crisis. Mark Snelling/British Red \nCross. \n \n \n3\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nMali Red Cross, supported directly by the Federation, provided an additional 329 MT of food. Four distribution \nrounds were planned over 120 days and took place at 104 sites among 14 communes in Timbuktu, Goundam and \nGourma-Rharous. They targeted 10,226 children, of whom 4,036 were female. Rations were composed of 250 \ngrammes of enriched flour (CSB), 30 grammes of oil and 20 grammes of sugar per child per day.  \n \nNiger: The Federation completed its two rounds of general food distribution in Tillab\u00e9ri and Agadez provinces by \nmid-October 2005, in line with the onset of the year\u2019s harvest. An estimated 143,558 beneficiaries were reached and \nover 3.327 MT of foodstuffs distributed. \n \nGiven the immense distances involved both within and between distribution areas, two logistical hubs were \nestablished for each distribution centre \u2013 one in Filingu\u00e9 and one in Agadez. A dedicated group of Red Cross \nSociety of Niger volunteers were recruited and trained for the operation (130 in Tillab\u00e9ri and 50 in Agadez). The \nRed Cross teams worked in close cooperation with village heads and local leaders in identifying and confirming \nbeneficiaries.  \n \nImpact \nThe nutritional status of vulnerable families was markedly increased. It was estimated that calorie intake had been \nraised from 90 calories per person to 1,777 calories per person, which was within the accepted norm of 2,100 \ncalories per person. \n \nConstraints \nTargeting and initial estimates of numbers of beneficiaries for general food distributions were based on government \ncensus figures. As a result, beneficiary numbers were generally underestimated and members of semi-nomadic \ncommunities were not always included. Furthermore, relief teams identified a number of \u2018gap villages\u2019 with \nequivalent needs that had not been included in lists initially received. A degree of \u2018on-the-spot diplomacy\u2019 and \nflexibility ended up being demonstrated by Federation relief teams in allocating rations and adjusting second round \ndistributions in order to meet the needs of additional people vulnerable throughout a number of communities. \n \nThe distances and remote nature of many villages created logistical challenges and an increased workload for relief \ndistributions \u2013 in one case mules were used as a local means of transportation for general food distributions.  In \nBurkina Faso, the greatest constraints were distances between the capital, Ouagadougou, and main areas of \noperation, posing a challenge in purchasing, transport and general programme implementation. Distributions in \nareas such as Soum were complicated by the existence of large areas of swampy land following the rainy season, \nmaking access highly difficult. To counter the problem, distribution points were established in the nearest dry areas. \nAlthough new distribution points posed greater travelling distances for beneficiaries, they remained accessible by \ncart enabling the local population to still receive much needed food assistance in a fairly timely manner.   \n \nIn Mali, transport was challenging as some villages were not reachable by road; \u2018pinasses\u2019 or motorized pirogues \nwere, therefore, rented. Unfortunately, pinasses could not ensure totally secure transportation since some goods \ncould become wet and unusable and others could be lost overboard. Furthermore, the duration of distributions in \nMali was prolonged due to difficulties in the identification of children as many bear similar names.  In addition, due \nto migration habits, organizing distributions for nomadic populations was generally a challenge.  \n \nSpecific objective 2: (Health \u2013 supplementary feeding): Provide basic health services through emergency \nsupplementary feeding for targeted vulnerable children aged under five years, to a total population of 24,500 \nin Niger. \n \nAchievements \nRed Cross/Red Crescent supplementary feeding programmes were operational in Niger since 1 August 2005 in \ncooperation with the French Red Cross (who already had an established bilateral programme in Niger), the Qatari \nRed Crescent and the Spanish Red Cross in the regions of Tahoua, Maradi, Zinder, Tanout and Agadez. By the \nclose of September 2005, the government of Niger had a new protocol in place, establishing its responsibility for the \nnutritional situation in the country. By that time, the Federation was questioning the merits of a \u2018parallel system\u2019 of \na supplementary feeding being conducted by the international humanitarian community as a long-term venture. It \nbecame clear that the Federation, in partnership with the Red Cross Society of Niger needed to assist government \nregional authorities in making their health centre personnel more tangibly responsible for the management of \nmalnutrition. \n \n \n4\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nBy mid-January 2006, 48,525 moderately malnourished children had been treated through the Red Cross/Red \nCrescent supplementary feeding centres at Tahoua, Maradi, Zinder, Agadez-Arlit and Tanout. An additional 3,825 \nmoderately malnourished children were treated between February and September 2006. In addition to the treatment \nrations for malnourished children (UNIMIX), their families received protection rations, bringing the total number of \nbeneficiaries to 291,150. The protection rations were composed of 100 kg of cereals, 50 kg of beans and four litres \nof vegetable oil per month. This ration was halved after the harvest (end of October 2005), and was discontinued \ncompletely in December 2005.   \n \nConstraints  \nThe caseload of supplementary feeding centres was higher than \nexpected, putting additional strain and workload on Red Cross \nvolunteers \nand \ndelegates. \nThe \noverwhelming \nresponse \nto \nsupplementary feeding and the provision of family protection rations \n\u2013 the combination of a health programme and relief activity \u2013 posed \nchallenges for ensuring quality programming, adequate training and \nservice provision, general staff supervision and management.  \nNiger Red Cross Society volunteers weighing \na little child. According to the Niger Red \nCross, many children were moderately or \nseverely \nmalnourished \nin \nNiger. \nOlav \nSaltbones/Norwegian Red Cross. \n \nAnother main challenge for the supplementary feeding treatment \nprogramme was the prevalence of malaria and other endemic diseases \nin Niger. As a result, the health programme of the Qatari Red \nCrescent involved additional training and treatment for malaria as \npart of its supplementary feeding activities. Vaccination programmes \nwere also implemented at a number of the feeding centres. \n \nThe protection ratios that were being provided to families with \nmalnourished children were ultimately discontinued due to the \nfollowing reasons:  \n\u2022 \nAnecdotal evidence indicated that children were been kept \ndeliberately malnourished so that their families could receive \nthe rations;  \n\u2022 \nObservations by staff and volunteers showed that some \nmothers took their children to the health centres only when \nthere were distributions of family rations;  \n\u2022 \nSome women gave their children purgative plants to keep \nthem thin, thus eligible for the programme. \n \nSpecific objective 3 (relief \u2013 cash distribution): As per the Revised Plan of Action of 7 August 2005, a cash \ndistribution was foreseen targeting 20,000 beneficiaries, or 4,000 households, to communities in Niger and \nMali. \n \nAchievements \nAs of 18 November 2005, cash distributions were completed at Tanout assisting 34,278 beneficiaries (5,713 \nhouseholds) in 88 villages and three pastoralist settlements. One-time cash grants of XOF 120,000 (approximately \nUSD 240 or EUR 182), were provided to each household.  \n \nAs part of the cash project \u2013 and through a unique partnership between the Federation, British Red Cross, Swedish \nRed Cross and University of Arizona \u2013 a monitoring regime began in the aftermath of the distributions to assess \ntheir impact at household, village, market and regional levels. Quantitative and qualitative information gathering \nalso focused on the impact of cash distributions on the nutritional status of recipient and non-recipient households. \nThe report of the evaluation is available upon request.  \n \nIn summary (according to the Phase III evaluation report), households that received financial support from the Red \nCross/Red Crescent were less likely to be indebted (4.9 per cent compared to 25.3 per cent). Among indebted \nhouseholds, cash recipients were lesser in debt compared to those who did not receive cash (average amount to be \nrepaid XOF 24,514 for cash villages and XOF 64,625 for control villages). These findings support reports from \n \n \n5\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nPhase I and II evaluations, which indicated that households used financial resources from the Red Cross cash \ndistribution to pay off loans and reduce indebtedness. The reports are available upon request. \n \nImpact \nAssistance was provided to 5,713 vulnerable families at a critical juncture in the yearly cycle, by providing them \nwith the means to manage their immediate economic needs and reestablish their households on a more secure \nfinancial footing.  \n \nConstraints \nOpposition to cash distribution by some non-governmental and international organizations, coupled with unclear \nsupport from the authorities, led to a degree of confusion that came close to derailing the project. A last-minute \nmessage received from the Governor of Zinder, conveyed through the Head of the CCA (who is responsible to the \nCabinet and Office of the Prime Minister), temporarily suspended cash distributions just prior to the scheduled start \nof the project. Following extensive negotiations, a formal agreement with the government was reached, sanctioned \nby the President of Niger, with full support from the Red Cross Society of Niger. \n \nLack of banking facilities in Tanout and surrounding remote villages led to some logistical and security challenges. \nHowever, these were successfully addressed and the project progressed well. \n \nSpecific objective 4 (Logistics, administration and telecoms): Immediately augment the existing Red Cross \nand Red Crescent National Societies with logistical, administrative and telecommunications infrastructure in \nthe four different countries of the Sahel operation. \n \nAchievements \n \nIT/Telecoms: The Mali Red Cross benefited from the presence of an IT/Telecoms delegate during the first six \nmonths of the Sahel operation when the main installations were done. The Sahel operation IT/Telecoms team \ninstalled a wide area network/local area network (WAN/LAN) with an access point and Internet connection for \napproximately 15 users. A counterpart from the National Society was recruited and trained; before leaving Mali, the \nSahel operation IT/Telecom team handed over to the IT/telecom counterpart who would ensure proper maintenance \nof the equipment, with support from the team in Niamey. A total of five laptops and three radios were provided by \nthe British Red Cross and two new desktops, one network printer and radios by the Federation.  \n \nIn Mauritania, the Federation installed three high frequency (HF) and very high frequency (VHF) bases in Zoucrete, \nNouakchott and Nema/Nouadibhou, and two mobile HF and VHF units (with 15 handsets), in response to \npopulation movements.   \n \nIn Burkina Faso, the British Red Cross provided the Burkinabe Faso \nRed Cross Society with four laptops, two Thuraya satellite phones as \nwell as HF and VHF equipment in two vehicles.  \n \nIn addition to IT/telecom bases that already existed in Niger, the \nFederation provided the Red Cross Society of Niger with one laptop, \ntwo desktops, one network printer, two HF and VHF bases for Niamey \nand Tahoua as well as two HF and VHF mobiles and 15 handsets. An \nIT/telecom counterpart was recruited and trained, and an Internet \nconnection was provided. \n \nLogistics: Overall, logistics of the operation functioned well, despite \nsome under-staffing and staff change challenges. The fleet in Niger \nran at full capacity, with 31 Federation vehicles and 11 rental vehicles \ncovering over 200,000 km a month, often over difficult terrain. The \noperation in Mali was also a logistical success, as commodities were delivered to a much dispersed set of \nbeneficiaries, also over very challenging terrains.   \nInternational Federation officials preparing \nTSU trucks for food distributions in Niger. \nOlav Saltbones/Norwegian Red Cross. \n \n \n \n6\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \n                                                \nFor the distributions that were undertaken in Burkina Faso, 333.5 MT of rice, sorghum and oil were transported \nfrom the Red Cross Society of Niger/Federation/Transport Support Unit (TSU) warehouse in Niamey to the various \ndistribution sites. Two Federation logisticians were dispatched from Niger to support the relief delegate and the \nBurkinabe Red Cross Society to complete the distributions and to assess the National Society\u2019s capacities.  \n \nIn Filingue-Abala (Niger), as part of food-for-work activities, a sub-office and warehouse were temporarily \nestablished at Abala.  Ten Transport Support Unit trucks were dispatched as part of the food-for-work effort, and a \nstock of 200 MT of cereals was put in place. TSU operational hubs were based in Tahoua and Maradi, with \napproximately 20 trucks in each location and 30 trucks remaining in Niamey.  \n \nLogistics training in Niamey was completed, with similar training (for about 10 people per session for 3 days) \nundertaken in Zinder, Agadez, Tillabery, Tahoua and Maradi. The warehouse and compound of the Red Cross \nSociety of Niger were also renovated to include a new entry zone, an improved grading to protect the area against \nground water and rains as well as new roofing. \n \nApart from supporting the Federation and other Red Cross/Red Crescent activities, the TSU supported WFP \ncooperating partners such as Action Against Hunger (ACF 2), Concern and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) \nthrough \u2018cluster deployments\u2019 of up to ten trucks.  \n \nImpact \nThe logistics team supported Federation operations and Partner National Society programmes, concentrating its \nactivities on the general food distributions and supplementary feeding programmes. Though the enormous distances \nthat had to be covered (compounded by an often unreliable supply chain) posed some challenges, beneficiary needs \nwere met in a timely and regular manner. \n \nConstraints \nIn Burkina Faso, internal and external communications were hampered by a lack of equipment, difficult and \nunreliable connections and a lack of available technical personnel to pursue implementation of IT/telecoms activities. \n \nThe long distances involved in transporting goods across the region, the quality of the transport infrastructure and \nweather conditions at certain times, compounded by an unreliable supply chain, posed challenges for operational \nlogistics. Despite the constraints, the Federation possessed a dynamic logistics team able to overcome obstacles so \nthat beneficiary demands could be met in a timely and regular manner.   \n \nAmong logistical challenges, one difficulty was the imposition by the Government of Niger on limits of tonnage for \ntrucks passing through Niamey. Shipments for a number of organizations, most notably the Federation, WFP and \nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), were blocked in transit due to the new regulations which levied fines of \nXOF 10,000 per metric tonne on cargo exceeding 25 metric tonnes. In response, the Federation sought and received \na temporary exemption for its food commodities that were already en route. \n \nThe receipt of food commodities was a complicated process since limited information tended to be provided by \nfreight forwarders regarding expected delivery times. Discussions with freight forwarders on behalf of Sahel \nOperation staff improved the situation, resulting in the ultimate receipt of all goods.  \n \nSpecific objective 5 (Relief - livestock interventions for Mali and Niger): As per the Revised Plan of Action of \n7 August 2005, it was anticipated that 5,000 pastoralists would be assisted in Mali and Niger.   \n \nAchievements  \nThe food distributions also provided the opportunity to undertake parallel activities in the area of livestock health \nand support. On 11 November 2005, livestock vaccination sensitization campaigns started in different villages in the \nSalam Region, in cooperation with the Malian Ministry of Livestock. Radio stations broadcasted campaign \ninformation in four local languages and heads of villages were contacted as part of the sensitization process.   \n \n \n2 In French: Action Contre la Faim \n \n \n7\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \n                                                \nIn turn, 15,897 heads of livestock were vaccinated in Salam and Gourma Rharous. The number of cattle attended to \nwas well above the original target of 10,000, despite reticence amongst pastoralists in identifying exact numbers of \ncattle due to taxation implications.  \n \nIn December 2005 and January 2006, two rounds of fodder distributions were undertaken in the Salam Region. \nTheir purpose was to ensure livestock fodder consumption, prevent livestock sales on the markets and guarantee \nfodder in cold periods. There were two main breeder selection criteria; at least one malnourished child in the \nhousehold and breeders had to own between 10 and 50 livestock heads. Roughly 10,400 livestock heads benefited \nfrom fodder distributions totalling 180 MT. \n \nImpact \nReinforcing vulnerable livestock, thereby enabling on-going viability of pastoralist communities through a livestock \nvaccination programme and the distribution of fodder, enabled them to build up their livestock capacity so as to \nsurvive the extreme temperatures period that begins in December. \n \nSpecific objective 6 (Relief - cereal bank support for Mali and Niger): As per the Revised Plan of Action of 7 \nAugust 2005, it was anticipated that food stocks could be placed at cereal banks in 250 of the worst affected \ncommunities in Mali and Niger. \n \nAchievements \nAs monitoring progressed, it became evident that cereal banks could be a means of further assisting people affected \nby drought in Niger. Preliminary investigations suggested that as many as 50 villages could benefit from cereal \nbanks as a means of enhancing their longer-term food security.   \n \nA project manager from the British Red Cross arrived in Niger to develop a pilot cereal bank project, along with \nacademic staff from the University of Arizona. In addition to the funding provided by the British Red Cross, the \nFederation agreed to provide logistics support for the research and implementation phases of the pilot project.  \n \nVillage lands were identified, sites were confirmed using the Global Positioning System (GPS) and official \ndocuments were signed by village chiefs who authorized allocation of the land. A total of 21 cereal banks were \nconstructed in villages around Tanout; construction was completed in July, 2006, before the onset of the rainy \nseason. The banks were built using cement bricks, concrete and steel. The rationale for using these materials to \nbuild the cereal banks, instead of local traditional materials, was based on research done (reflecting on the use of \nboth types of products) with an important factor being the reduction of overhead costs, thus contributing to longer-\nterm sustainability. \n \nTwenty one village committees for cereal bank management were created and a three-day management training was \nconducted. Several items, including tables, chairs, notebooks, pens and cleaning products for the cereal banks, were \nprovided. Since the cereal banks began operating during the lean season, rice sales started immediately after \nconstruction was completed and management committees were in place.   \n \nAccording to the original design, households were required to pay a XOF 500 membership fee in order to purchase \ncereals3 from the banks. In Farak, 200 households were active in the cereal banks, with each household eligible to \npurchase up to five tias per week.  Funds collected from the sales were to be kept until after the harvest, when prices \ndropped significantly and more cereals could be purchased for use in the next lean season. \n \nConstraints \nDue to the requirement to pay membership fees, it was found out that 30 per cent of households were not accessing \nfood in the banks by July 2006. Management committees were primarily comprised of men, and it was not possible \nto ascertain whether the most vulnerable households were represented in the committees. Given that literacy and \nnumeracy skills were some of the criteria used to select members of the committee, it is likely that the most \nvulnerable households were not represented. In Farak, CARE had been working for two years, providing support to \n \n3 During a post-operation evaluation of the project, a meeting with women in Farak village revealed that they were paying XOF \n850 per tia of rice in the banks, compared to XOF 1,100 in the market.    \n \n \n8\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \n                                                \nwomen\u2019s village banks. The skills gained by the women in managing cereal banks could have been capitalized upon \nin setting up the management committee for the Red Cross-supported cereal banks. Women, who had proven their \nability to manage the savings of village banks and had gained the trust of their members, could have formed the \nmanagement committees. The Red Cross has realized this and in future, such interventions shall take into \nconsideration available skills and gender balance. \n \nSpecific objective 7 (Health \u2013 post-emergency health for Niger): Sustainable health interventions to promote \nresilience and improve the longer-term health of the most vulnerable are advocated.   \n \nAchievements \n \nMalnutrition strategy \nAs part of the technical support-transition process for the integrated health centres (CSI)4, and on behalf of the \nFederation and the Red Cross Society of Niger, 60 health officers and 30 general staff were trained in malnutrition \nscreening and treatment (according to the national protocol), and supplementary feeding stock management. The \ntraining and integration of services was undertaken in 15 health centres, including Hadachimo, Mogheur, Dangona, \nMaboya, Ill\u00e9la, Bagaroua, S\u00e9hia, T\u00e9baram, Toulou, Edir, Dandoutchi, Taja\u00e9, Dandaji and Moull\u00e9la. As part of the \nintegration strategy, the Federation trained 40 Red Cross Society of Niger volunteers who will continue providing \ntechnical support to community health centres.  \n \nBecause chronic malnutrition is a result of specific behaviours towards food and hygiene, the main focus of the \nSahel operation health team at Tahoua was educating key people (matrons within communities and Red Cross \nSociety of Niger volunteers) as agents who would sensitize and mobilize the local populations. To this end, 60 \nmatrons and 40 Red Cross Society of Niger volunteers working with the CSI in Tahoua and Ill\u00e9la districts were \ntrained in nutrition information, education and communication (IEC).  \n \nMatrons were considered key people as they are usually the traditional advisers of mothers on children\u2019s health \nissues within communities. Training sessions for matrons typically lasted two days while for volunteers took one \nday. A training of trainers (ToT) session for Red Cross Society of Niger counterparts in nutrition and education was \nalso undertaken through the health programme in Tahoua. In addition, 150 training sessions on nutrition followed in \nJuly 2006.  \n \nMobile health \nFollowing a pilot mobile health team project initiated in October 2005 in the Tahoua area, a Memorandum of \nUnderstanding was entered into with the regional health authorities for on-going delivery of much needed basic \nhealth care to remote communities that lacked access to basic health services.  \n \nIn November 2005, three mobile clinics were set up in Tahoua, with five trained volunteers in each. They visited 48 \ndifferent sites (120 villages in three different health districts), often together with the major (nurse) from the nearest \nhealth centre. During the visits, they vaccinated children aged under five years, made prenatal and post natal \nconsultations, sensitized women on basic health issues, conducted malnutrition screening, and provided de-worming \nmedication.  \n \nBetween March and August 2006, 9,888 children had been vaccinated and 1,906 de-wormed. The vaccination \ncoverage in the region where the clinics were operating was more than 90 per cent. 2,674 prenatal consultations \nwere held where women were vaccinated, and 3,731 malnourished children were identified and sent to malnutrition \ncentres. About 8,196 women were reached with messages/information on breastfeeding issues, weaning, diarrhoea, \nvaccination of new-borns, malaria, use of mosquito nets, food-environmental-and body hygiene, and family \nplanning. \n \nImpact \nThe mobile health teams contributed to the improvement of access to primary health in the Tahoua region. Due to \nimproved access, the vaccination coverage amongst children under 11 months was increased in the region and in \nother areas of operation under the supplementary feeding programmes. \n \n \n4 In French: Centre de Sant\u00e9 Int\u00e9gr\u00e9 (CSI) \n \n \n9\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nConstraint \nDistances to these remote villages were great, sometimes between 150 and 230 km, and road access was non-\nexistent.  \n \nSpecific objective 8: Water and sanitation (WatSan), Niger \n \nAchievements \nFollowing an assessment mission undertaken in September 2005, a number of potential water and sanitation \nactivities were outlined that were to be implemented immediately or over the mid-term and longer-term. Among the \nactivities were the following: construction and rehabilitation of well; construction and rehabilitation of school \nlatrines; and construction and rehabilitation of family latrines. With assistance from the Swedish Red Cross, \nimplementation of WatSan activities began. The programme was later scaled up with financial support from the \nQatari Red Crescent and it is being implemented after the close of the Sahel operation.  \n \nEighty volunteers from the Red Cross Society of Niger were trained in Participatory Hygiene and Sanitation \nTransformation (PHAST), a methodology that builds on people\u2019s innate ability to address and resolve their own \nproblems. In turn, the Red Cross volunteers trained community-based volunteers in the targeted villages; the Red \nCross volunteers were equipped with motorbikes to facilitate easy reach (five villages per volunteer). More than 70 \nof these volunteers conducted sensitization activities in 235 villages of Tahoua, Tillabery and Zinder. In Tahoua and \nin Filingu\u00e9, 110 water management committees have been formed and their members trained. The committees are \nnow responsible for managing the wells constructed/rehabilitated under the project. Similar committees will be \nestablished in Zinder. The WatSan activities will continue until end of July 2007. \n \nImpact \nHygiene promotion, using the PHAST methodology, in Tahoua contributed towards cholera prevention \u2013 in 2006 \u2013 \nin areas where cholera is endemic, such as in Bouza.   \n \nConstraints \nAt the beginning, implementation of activities was slow because there were no community-based volunteers in the \ntargeted villages. Due to delays in implementation, water and sanitation activities should continue for two years to \nassure the ownership of the infrastructure by the beneficiaries. \n \nSpecific objective 9: Logistics \u2013 capacity building  \n \nAchievements \nDifferent trainings were provided to the Red Cross Society of Niger volunteers and staff. The sessions include a \ntraining that was held in Niamey for 15 members of the governance and executive branches of the National Society. \nThe five-day workshop covered issues such as project planning, logistics, preparedness and response, procurement, \nwarehousing and transport management as well as IT/telecommunications. During the last day of training, a visit to \nthe National Society\u2019s warehouse and a brainstorming session were undertaken about the future of logistics within \nthe Red Cross Society of Niger. Three days of training were also held for volunteers and staff members in Zinder, \nAgadez, Tillabery, Tahoua and Maradi.  \n \nAn emergency stock of 1,000 MT of cereals was pre-positioned for the Red Cross Society of Niger at its Niamey \nwarehouse. The emergency stock was treated as per Federation standards, with National Society staff members \ntrained in warehousing techniques. In the framework of the general logistics training, a specific module on \nwarehousing was provided. At the Red Cross Society of Niger Tahoua base, a logistics counterpart was fully \nintegrated into Federation activities.   \n \nSpecific objective 10: Relief-livelihoods capacity building in Niger. \n \nAchievements \n \nLivelihoods small grants programme \nThe small grants project was implemented by the Irish Red Cross in Agadez and divided into two parts; family \ngrants and collective grants for micro-projects. Family grants were meant to assist vulnerable families until the next \nrainy season and reinforce their coping mechanisms in future by contributing to replenishment of their household \n \n \n10\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \neconomy. Collective grants for micro-projects were oriented towards reinforcement of food security of local \ncommunities.  \n \nAfter a series of surveys and assessments, the Irish Red Cross, as the manager of the activity, decided to provide \ngrants to ten per cent of the vulnerable populations in each village (people aged over 60 years, and \npregnant/lactating women). Focus groups, with women, revealed that small animals were considered the highest \npriority to improve livelihood security; some women identified food as their greatest need while others indicated the \nneed for alternative sources of income, such as weaving palm frond for sale in the local market.  \nAccordingly, the Red Cross implemented a programme where staff, with support from branch volunteers, purchased \nsmall ruminants (sheep and goats) in bulk for distribution to targeted households. Beneficiaries participated in \nassessing the general health of the animals before they were purchased. Cereals were also purchased in bulk and \ngiven to extremely vulnerable households, based on family size. Finally, palm fronds were provided directly to \nwomen to make mats, and the Red Cross volunteers assisted in marketing.  This programme ended in August 2006. \n \nFood-for-work projects: In Mali, in addition to relief food distributions, \u2018food for work\u2019 and \u2018food-for-training\u2019 \nprogrammes were implemented up to end of November 2005. \u2018Food-for-work\u2019 and \u2018food-for-training\u2019 distributions \nwere made at the beginning and the end of the work/training sessions, and they aimed at protecting the child rations \nalready distributed. Among the food-for-work projects were dyke construction, reforestation, water pipe \nconstruction, irrigation, warehouse construction and market gardening.  \n \nFood-for-training projects were mainly oriented towards HIV/AIDS sensitization, elimination of illiteracy and \nnutrition education. Beneficiaries received 2 kg of cereals and 75 grammes of oil per day when participating in a \nfood-for-work project and 1.2 kg of cereals and 45 grammes of oil per day when participating in a training session. \n \nIn Niger, following an initial assessment and discussions with community members on the most important needs at \nthe community level, food-for-work projects were designed and implemented in Agadez, in Filingue-Abala, and in \nTahoua.   \n \nA pilot project was undertaken in Fadama and Tillimoune, two villages north of Abala and close to the Mali border. \nActivities in both villages focused on provision of water and agriculture. They included: \n\u2022 \nSoil recuperation and improvement of a water catchment in Fadama and Tillimoune; \n\u2022 \nRehabilitation of a community well in Fadama and Tillimoune. \n \nBy July 2006, 1,113 workers had benefited from the food-for-work projects in Tillimoune and Fadama. In \nTillimoune, the projects included well rehabilitation and soil rehabilitation (through construction of half moons), \nconstruction of stone walls and planting trees. Rehabilitation of wells was completed, and 2,630 forest half moons, \n5,008 agricultural half-moons and 4.16 km of stone lines were installed. More than 6,000 trees were planted. In \nFadama, in addition to soil rehabilitation, there were three additional projects; one to deepen a pond (to make it a \nyear-round catchment area), the second to build four micro-dams (to slow down water flow so that water would \nfilter down to the water table), and the third to rehabilitate a deep well. All projects were identified by communities. \nWell reconstruction and the four micro-dams were completed.  \n \nIn Tahoua, four food-for-work projects were conducted to recuperate 80 hectares of land through the construction of \nhalf-moons and planting acacia trees. A total of 23,710 half-moons were dug, and 5,200 acacia trees were planted.  \nA rotation system for teams of workers was established so that each team would work for one day out of three, \nleaving the other two days available for working in their fields. At least 719 persons, including 77 branch volunteers \nand 10 technical specialists, worked in the projects and received sufficient food to meet their family needs for one \nmonth.    \n \nImpact \nThe assistance provided to 5,713 vulnerable families at a critical juncture in the yearly cycle, helped them with the \nmeans to manage their immediate economic needs and re-establish their households on a more secure financial \nfooting.  \n \n \n \n11\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nThe relatively substantial cash grant provided vulnerable households with a choice in coping mechanisms. \nEvaluation reports indicate that families that benefited from small grants used the funds to buy foodstuffs, cattle and \nnecessary household implements, such as carts, and to pay off debts. This showed that households prioritized \ninvesting in their longer-term economic viability over shorter-term needs. \n \nHouseholds were not constrained to pay off debts by selling their harvest at a loss. Cash-in-hand enabled agro-\npastoralist communities to decide when to buy and when to sell, thereby ensuring better management of their \nharvest and livestock. It also enabled stockpiling of millet, to help families apportion their harvest to last them \nthrough the lean period, which soon followed.  \n \nConstraints \nUnfortunately, one of the dams constructed in Fadama did not hold, and there was insufficient time remaining in the \nproject to rehabilitate the dam. In addition, trees were not planted as expected and the Red Cross eventually gave \n2,000 of the trees to the Department of the Environment for planting elsewhere. \n \nSpecific objective 11 (Reporting-media-communications \u2013 advocacy and public information): Promote and \ndisseminate within the target audience the activities highlighted in the Supplementary Plan of Action \u2013 \nAppeal Extension and overall Sahel operation.    \n \nAchievements  \nThroughout the operation, the Federation information delegate held regular interviews with international, local and \nregional media. The delegate also accompanied camera teams to the field, and briefed journalists interested in the \nrelief operation as well as communication teams of Partner National Societies. In addition, key documents, \nphotographs and fact sheets were developed and shared with partners, stakeholders and national societies interested \nand/or involved in the operation. Articles were published on the Federation\u2019s website and a dedicated section \nfocusing on the Sahel food crisis was created.  \n \nContinuous training was provided to the Federation regional information officer, in Dakar, on the professional role \nforeseen within the Federation, focusing on information-gathering during disasters and reporting. This aimed at \nensuring continuity of highlighting forgotten disasters once the operation closed. In addition, documents on \ninformation management during disasters \u2013 produced by the Inter-Americas Communicators Network \u2013 were shared \nwith the Red Cross Society of Niger press officer.  \n \nTraining packages on promotion of Humanitarian Values and Red Cross principles, including information on the \nCode of Conduct of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief, were given to \nFederation staff and Partner National Societies working in the Sahel operation (in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger). \nThe aim was to reinforce knowledge of Red Cross principles and values among the volunteers involved in the food-\ncrisis operation, especially newcomers. \n \nCoordination \n \nWithin the Red Cross/Red Crescent Movement \nCoordination and cooperation within logistics, human resources and programme support was established between \nthe Federation and Participating National Societies, in particular the French Red Cross, the Irish Red Cross, the \nQatari Red Crescent, the Saudi Arabian Red Crescent and the Spanish Red Cross. As the Sahel operation developed, \ncontact was also established with the Iranian Red Crescent as it has a long-standing and noteworthy presence in \nNiger.  \n \nThe Federation regional delegation in Dakar facilitated and coordinated the deployment of Regional Disaster \nResponse Team (RDRT) members from West Africa. Staff provided by the National Societies of Algeria, Benin, \nCameroon, Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Nigeria and Togo played a crucial role since the \nearliest stages of the operation. Their involvement was pivotal for the development, implementation and success of \nvarious activities. It signalled the reliable expertise available throughout different countries in the region.   \n \nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) provided regular security updates. ICRC also provided \ntraining for volunteers from the Red Cross Society of Niger, in Tahoua.  \n \n \n12\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nWith beneficiaries \nAt the local and regional-country level, relief and supplementary feeding activities were undertaken in collaboration \nwith local and provincial authorities to facilitate coordination while underlining and ensuring respect for \nFundamental Principles of the Red Cross Movement. Heads of villages were, in particular, closely linked to the Red \nCross/Red Crescent response due to their pivotal role within communities.   \n \nWith government agencies \nAn effective working relationship was established with the main governmental bodies involved in the crisis \u2013 such \nas Cellule de Crise Alimentaire (CCA) and Syst\u00e8me d\u2019Alerte Pr\u00e9coce (SAP) \u2013 and with key government of Niger \nministries, in cooperation with the Red Cross Society of Niger. The ministries included the Ministry of Health and \nthe Ministry of Community Development.  In Tahoua (Niger), the Red Cross/Red Crescent worked very closely \nwith regional government health staff. This facilitated competency development and the eventual transfer of \nsupplementary feeding centres to the government.    \n \nWith other agencies \nSince the onset of the Sahel operation, the Federation collaborated closely with United Nations agencies \n(particularly in the organization of transport services and provision of food assistance), and the broader \nhumanitarian community, most notably in the health sector.   \n \nThe operation had a series of partnerships, which enabled the Red Cross/Red Crescent to draw on other forms of \nexpertise, as well as additional financial resources to support the activities. Collegial support for various Federation \nactivities was received from organizations such as Concern, GOAL, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), Oxfam and \nSave the Children-UK.   \n \nThrough the Transport Support Unit (TSU), the Federation developed relationships with WFP and its implementing \npartners. Greater numbers of beneficiaries were assisted on a timely basis through food distribution and food-for-\nwork than would have been possible had the TSU not been established.   \n \nThe Spanish Red Cross in Maradi had an agreement with MSF-France, where severely malnourished children \nwould be referred to MSF for treatment, and moderately malnourished children seeking assistance at MSF clinics \nwould be referred to Red Cross clinics for treatment.   \n \nThe British Red Cross contracted the services of the University of Arizona to monitor the impact of the cash \ndistribution project in Tanout. This had the effect of bringing in highly qualified experts who provided objectivity in \nmonitoring data and impact. \n \nConcern referred children (when they have reached 80 per cent of their weight) from its acute malnutrition feed \ncentres to the Red Cross/Red Crescent. Concern invested considerable time to ensure that its supplementary feeding \nactivities did not overlap those of the Red Cross.   \n \nNational Society Capacity Building \nIn general, all sectors of the intervention contained elements for training and support of volunteers and staff of Host \nNational Societies. Among the various aspects of the Sahel operation, a network of more than 360 volunteers was \ntrained as part of the initial emergency response in the areas of relief, health care, logistics, administration, \ntelecommunications, reporting and media relations. In a relatively short time, their knowledge of the Red Cross/Red \nCrescent Movement was greatly enhanced. As key players in an operational partnership, volunteers and staff \nconsistently showed their dedication and skills.     \n \nThe counterpart system was very successful, especially in supplementary feeding centres, mobile health clinics, \ncommunity health, water and sanitation, and food-for-work. In all these sectors, activities were implemented using \ncounterparts from local Red Cross branches.   \n \nTraining of Burkinabe Red Cross Society volunteers in registration and distribution procedures was undertaken in \nconjunction with its first aid section. In each province of Burkina Faso, a team of 30 volunteers supported by a \nsupervisor, team leader and logistician was established. Volunteers were then deployed to the various target areas or \n\u2018d\u00e9partements\u2019 within the province and the supervisor/team leader continued to work alongside the volunteers. \n \n \n13\n \nBurkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger: Food Insecurity; Appeal no. 05EA015; Final Report \n \nWith support from the operation, the Tahoua branch of the Red Cross Society of Niger rehabilitated its offices, \nincreased its professional competency and strengthened its financial management capability. A number of \nvolunteers were trained and they in turn provided support to local health centres and other key community health \nactivities. The branch also developed its logistics capacity to provide necessary support, when needed, in Tahoua. \n \nMonitoring and evaluation \nWith a variety of Movement actors continuing their presence in Niger following the closure of the operation, a \nfocused evaluation was commissioned by the Federation to review efforts undertaken under the Sahel Operation. \nThe evaluation particularly emphasized on Niger (which was the most affected country, and where the operation \nreally focused on), to help determine how the remaining actors can capitalize on their presence, interests and \nstrengths in reflection of continuing needs in the country.  \n \nThe evaluation focused on three thematic areas: appropriateness of the disaster response intervention; processes; \nand relationships. The findings indicate that through the Sahel operation, the Red Cross/Red Crescent contributed to \nthe reduction of the short-term effects of the drought. The Red Cross/Red Crescent intervention helped to reduce \nfood insecurity and addressed the needs of moderately malnourished children, among others. \n \nFor further information specifically related to this operation please contact: \n\u2022 \nIn Dakar: Alasan Senghore, Federation Head of Zone for West and Central Africa, Dakar; email: \nalasan.senghore@ifrc.org; telephone +221.869.36.41; fax +221.860.20.02. \n \nAll International Federation assistance seeks to adhere to the Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and \nRed Crescent Movement and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO's) in Disaster Relief and is committed to the \nHumanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards in Disaster Response (Sphere) in delivering assistance to the most \nvulnerable. \n \nFor longer-term programmes in this or other countries or regions, please refer to the Federation\u2019s Annual Appeal. \nFor support to or for further information concerning Federation programmes or operations in this or other \ncountries, or for national society profiles, please also access the Federation\u2019s website at http://www.ifrc.org\n \n \n<Final financial report below; click here to return to the title page> \n \n \n14\nSelected Parameters\nReporting Timeframe\n2005/4-2007/8\nBudget Timeframe\n2005/4-2007/8\nAppeal\nM05EA015\nBudget\nAPPEAL\nAll figures are in Swiss Francs (CHF)\nFinal Financial Report\nM05EA015 - BURKINA FASO, MALI, MAURITANIA & NIGER: FOOD INSEC\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies\nI.

Funds have been reimbursed. \n \nSummary: Most of the Appeal objectives were only partially met as a result of low and slow response from \npartners as well as limited food stocks in the country. With respect to the emergency food distribution \nintervention, the Eritrean Relief and Refugee Commission (ERREC1) reduced the number of beneficiaries \nto 40,000 and the food ratio to 1,400 kcal due to limited food stocks in the country. Though the number of \ntargeted people and the rations were decreased, the food distributed contributed towards reducing \neconomic hardships among families by preventing them from selling their animals for immediate \nconsumption. The food distribution also contributed to improving their nutritional status. \n \nThe emergency and short-term food distribution activities were further affected by the introduction of new \npolicies by the Eritrean government in June 2005, relating to the administration of non-governmental \norganizations (NGOs). The government also introduced policies on free food aid distribution in September \n2005. This prompted the national society to request for an extension of the operation\u2019s timeframe (three \ntimes) to 31 October 2006. Discussions held between RCSE, the Federation and the Eritrean government \nto address concerns linked to suspension of the food distribution exercise did not bear fruit.  \n \nNevertheless, the national society was largely successful in implementing activities under the emergency \nand medium-term integrated health interventions. A total of 8 boreholes and 1 reservoir were rehabilitated \nand 1 check dam and 2 sub-surface dams were constructed, benefiting 16,150 people. The beneficiaries \ncan now access water from nearby water points and in greater quantity.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1 ERREC is a government agency charged with coordinating government and non-governmental agencies engaged \nin the drought relief work \n \n \n2\nThe situation \nFollowing five consecutive years of drought, the humanitarian situation in Eritrea had deteriorated, to such an \nextent that led to the launching of this Emergency Appeal on 27 January 2005. Prior to this Appeal, the Red \nCross Society of Eritrea (RCSE) and the Federation had implemented two successive Emergency Appeals, \n33/2003 and 04/2004. \n \nThe Appeal was launched to assist 55,000 beneficiaries in Hagaz sub-Zoba and other adjacent villages for 12 \nmonths. It focused on emergency and short-term food distribution, medium-term rehabilitation and \nconstruction of water resources, medium-term food security and sustainable livelihood as well as improved \nhealth practices. These activities were implemented by RCSE in 17 administration areas. Capacity building \nactivities for the national society and advocacy activities were also integrated into this drought operation.  \n \nRed Cross and Red Crescent action \n \nEmergency food and water assistance \n \nObjective 1: To immediately improve livelihood and food security by provision of monthly food distributions to \n55,0002 people for eight months. \n \nAchievements \nBetween April and September 2005, RCSE reached a total of 9,429 households (40,000 beneficiaries) from \n17 villages in Hagaz sub-zoba with 2,520 tonnes of wheat, 180 tonnes of lentils, 144 tonnes of vegetable oil \nand 12 tonnes of salt. The table below gives a detailed summary on how the food was distributed in the \nadministrative villages of Hagaz sub-zoba. \n \nTable 1: Food distribution from April to September 2005 in Hagaz sub-zoba \n \nNumber of beneficiaries \nFood distributed (T) \nAdministrative \nvillages \nHousehold\ns \nIndividual \nWheat \nLentils \nVegetable \noil \nSalt \nHagaz /Harnet \n1,441 \n6,264\n394.632\n28.188\n22.548 \n0.188\nHagaz /Adalet \n1,380 \n5,200\n327.6\n11.70\n9.36 \n1.56\nAdi Fakai \n496 \n1,836\n115.668\n4.131\n3.306 \n0.55\nFana \n313 \n1,196\n75.348\n2.691\n2.154 \n0.36\nAwanjeli \n287 \n1,437\n90.534\n3.234\n2.586 \n0.432\nEdamr \n334 \n1,678\n105.714\n3.777\n3.021 \n0.504\nGhilas \n553 \n2,165\n136.398\n4.872\n3.897 \n0.65\nEnchinak \n365 \n1,732\n109.116\n3.897\n3.117 \n0.52\nShebek \n353 \n1,605\n101.106\n3.612\n2.889 \n0.482\nAdi Arei \n442 \n2,321\n146.226\n5.223\n4.179 \n0.696\nAdi-Omer \n311 \n1,127\n71.004\n2.535\n2.028 \n0.338\nShafteck \n661 \n2,970\n187.11\n6.684\n5.346 \n0.892\nHashishai \n874 \n3,201\n201.666\n7.203\n5.763 \n0.96\nBadob \n426 \n1,882\n118.566\n4.236\n3.387 \n0.564\nShenghin \n251 \n1,228\n77.364\n2.763\n2.211 \n0.368\nGolia \n290 \n1,433\n90.282\n3.225\n2.58 \n0.43\nFirdighi \n652 \n2,725\n171.678\n6.132\n4.905 \n0.818\nTotal \n9,429 \n40,000\n2,520.00\n104.10\n83.28 \n10.31\n \nImpact \nThe food distribution exercise contributed towards improving the nutritional status of 40,000 drought-affected \npeople. \n \n                                                 \n2 Kindly note that the number of beneficiaries was reduced from 55,000 to 40,000.  \n \n \n \n \n3\nConstraints \nFollowing a road accident on the Keren-Hagaz road, 6.7 tonnes of wheat and 171 kg of vegetable oil were \ndestroyed. The food distribution was also affected by a policy introduced by the Eritrean government in June \n2005, on the administration of NGOs. The government subsequently introduced nominal tax requirements for \nimported relief items, resulting in the delayed release of imported Red Cross relief food from Massawa Port. \nThis tax was eventually paid by the Ministry of Labour and Human Welfare.  \n \nIn September 2005, the Eritrean government introduced a cash-for-work strategy which affected the national \nSociety\u2019s free food aid distribution. The new strategy necessitated screening of vulnerable people at national \nlevel. At the same time, all humanitarian organizations working in Eritrea (including the Red Cross) were \ndirected to suspend free food distribution. This suspension affected the Finnish Red Cross\u2019s donation of 220 \ntonnes of wheat, which was redirected to the Tanzanian Red Cross National Society\u2019s (TRCNS\u2019s) emergency \ndrought operation. \n \nIn order to preserve the quality of the food in storage and reduce risks of infestation, fumigation was \nconducted in May 2006 by a private local company, with technical support from the regional logistics unit in \nNairobi. This resulted in incurring fumigation costs and extra storage and transportation costs that had not \nbeen budgeted for.  \n \nObjective 2: To improve sustainable livelihoods and food security by provision of monthly food distributions to \n27,500 people for four months depending on crop yields in September 2005. \n \nAchievements \nThe food distribution exercise which was planned for September 2005 did not take place due to changes in \ngovernment policies. The Federation and/or RCSE held talks with the concerned authorities to resume \ndistribution as soon as possible. Eventually, the Ministry of Labour and Human Welfare took possession of \nthe remaining relief food (amounting to 1,688.78 tonnes) from the RCSE warehouse. \n \nObjective 3: To reduce morbidity and vulnerability to water-related diseases by improving access to safe \ndrinking water. \n \nAchievements \nA total of 8 boreholes and 1 reservoir were rehabilitated and 1 check dam was constructed, benefiting 16,150 \npeople. The rehabilitated boreholes were fitted with solar-powered hand pumps. One of the rehabilitated \nboreholes in Gizgiza is specifically for the livestock, as it is not safe for human consumption. \n \nTable 2: Construction and rehabilitation of water points in Hagaz sub-zoba  \n \nAdministrative villages \nAchievements \nNumber of beneficiaries \nFelhito and Karwat \n1 borehole rehabilitated  \n500 people  \nAdi-Omer  \n1 borehole rehabilitated, 1 reservoir \nrehabilitated  \n600 people and 400 livestock \nMuruni River  \n1 borehole rehabilitated  \n1,500 people  \nHashishay  \n3 boreholes rehabilitated and solar-\npowered hand pump maintained  \n10,000 people  \nGizgiza \n2 boreholes rehabilitated and 1 check \ndam constructed. \n3,550 people \nTotal \n8 boreholes, 1 reservoir and 1 check \ndam  \n16,150 people \n \nTo encourage the effective use of water, 48 participants from 6 administrative villages received a 5-day \ntraining on water management and collection systems.  \n \nImpact \nPreviously, the community members of Muruni had to walk for a total of eight hours on steep and rugged \nterrain to access water points. They now have access water from nearby sources and the time spared can be \nused to accomplish other duties. In Felhito, Karwat and Adi-Omer communities, the rehabilitation of the \nboreholes reduced the walking distance from two kilometers to one kilometer, and reduced congestion at \nwater points. \n \n \n \n4\nMedium-term food security, sustainable livelihoods and integrated health \n \nObjective 1: To increase medium-term food security through distribution of seeds and farming tools to 10,000 \nhouseholds \n \nAchievements \nThe plan was to distribute 300 tonnes of sorghum and 30 tonnes of beans to 10,000 households. However, \nonly 1,168 households received 5.843 tonnes of drought-resistant peer millet seeds. The procurement of the \nseeds was made locally and the Ministry of Agriculture assisted by checking the quality. The distribution was \nconducted in June 2006, before the start of the rainy season in July so to prevent consumption of seeds. The \ntargeted beneficiaries identified in nine villages included those who lost their coping mechanisms \u2013such as \nthe traditional methods of preserving seeds \u2013 owing to prolonged drought. \n \nConstraints \nGiven the shortage of funding and limited supply of drought-resistant seeds locally, 8,832 households were \nnot reached. Furthermore, the identification of beneficiaries was challenging since the degree of vulnerability \nwas similar for nearly all beneficiaries. \n \nObjective 2: Promote food security through the improvement of farming practices. \n \nAchievements \nThere were plans to conduct training sessions in pitting (for improved seed-bed creation) and water \nharvesting techniques such as ridging for the RCSE volunteers as well as farmer-to-farmer exchange \nsessions between villages through participatory activities. Unfortunately, these activities were not \nimplemented because the water resource specialist, previously identified for this task, was reassigned to \nother missions. \n \nObjective 3: To reduce morbidity and vulnerability to water-related diseases by improving access to safe \ndrinking water. \n \nAchievements \nFive administrative villages were identified for the medium-term projects which included construction of two \ncheck dams, two sub-surface dams and the rehabilitation of hand-dug wells in Gizgiza, Muruni, Felhito and \nEnchinak villages. In April 2006, 288 gabions were built to support the construction of the two sub-surface \ndams and two check dams. The community participated by collecting stones and filling the gabions.  \n \nImpact \nThe rehabilitated well in Enchinak ensured sufficient supply of water within a reasonable distance for 4,200 \nresidents who previously experienced critical water shortage. \n \nConstraints \nUnavailability of gabions in the country delayed the construction of the sub-surface dams and check dams. \nThus, the gabions had to be imported from Kenya, with the assistance of the regional procurement unit in \nNairobi. Furthermore, the poor state of the road to Muruni hampered the transportation of stones. \n \nObjective 4: To improve the heath status of targeted communities through community-based first aid (CBFA), \nParticipatory Hygiene and Sanitation Transformation (PHAST) and provision of basic sanitation installations. \n \nAchievements \n80 students selected from three schools were trained in community-based first aid (CBFA) for five days. The \nschools cover three kebabis (administrative areas) where the Red Cross Society of Eritrea provided food and \nwater.  \n \nConstraints \nTraining sessions in Participatory Hygiene and Sanitation Transformation (PHAST) and basic sanitation \ninstallations were not carried out due to shortage of funding. \n \nObjective 5: To improve household economy and reduce environmental degradation through the provision of \nfuel-efficient stoves. \n \n \n \n5\nAchievements \nThe RCSE held discussions with the Ministry of Agriculture on training related to the construction and use of \nfuel-efficient stoves and home management targeting 30 women from 10 administrative villages. However, \ndue to inadequate funds the proposed activities did not take place.  \n \nAdvocacy and public information \n \nObjective 1: To ensure that the needs and rights of the most vulnerable in relation to the drought situation \nare secured. \n \nAchievements \nWith the Federation\u2019s support, the RCSE produced a press release and stories3 on the drought in Eritrea, \nwhich were posted on the Federation\u2019s website. The national society, in collaboration with the Federation, \nalso coordinated the production of a video on the water and food crisis in Hagaz sub-zoba. The Swedish Red \nCross translated this video into Swedish in order to reach a larger audience as well as use it as an information \ndisseminating tool.  \n \nA visiting team of students from a Swedish high school produced some still photos and conducted a radio \ninterview on some of the affected communities. These were broadcasted by the Swedish radio service. \n \nObjective 2: To promote the Movement\u2019s Fundamental Principles and Humanitarian Values in the \nintervention area. \n \nAchievements \nDissemination of the Movement\u2019s Fundamental Principles and Humanitarian Values were integrated into the \nfood distribution and water and sanitation (WatSan) activities.  \n \n84 people, from 17 administrative villages, were trained on volunteerism and relief management. During these \ntrainings, dissemination sessions on Red Cross/Red Crescent principles and the activities of the RCSE were \nincluded.  \n \nCapacity building \n \nObjective 1: To build the response and operational capacity of the national society at headquarters and \nbranch level. \n \nAchievements \nDue to its great experience in food distribution, the Red Cross Society of Eritrea took full responsibility in \ndrafting and implementing a food distribution plan. With minimal supervision from the Federation, all narrative \nand financial reports were prepared by the national society.  \n \nThe RCSE also developed its capacity in the WatSan sector through its involvement in the construction of \nsub-surface dams. This gave the national society an opportunity to further contribute to the overall national \npolicy on water.  \n \nThe regional logistics unit in Nairobi provided assistance to the national society in the procurement of items \ninternationally. A one-week workshop on logistics and procurement (international and local) was conducted \nfor 30 staff and volunteers from Red Cross branches and the headquarters. \n \nConstraints \nA court case against the Anseba branch Secretary resulted in suspension of activities of the branch. This \nmade the management of the operation complex, as the capacities of the branch members, including \nvolunteers, could not be fully utilized. Thus, all communication and implementation was managed directly \nfrom the headquarters.  \n \nIn addition, procurement of a field vehicle and basic office equipment could not be carried out due to limitation \nof funds. \n                                                 \n3\u2018Water brings hope to Eritrea\u2019s drought children\u2019 news story \u2013 http://www.ifrc.org/docs/news/05/05060101/  \n \n \n6\nLessons learned \nThe water trucking activity planned for implementation under emergency assistance was not carried out \nbecause the situation of the communities in Enchinak improved with the onset of rains. Moreover, water \ntrucking is considered to be costly and unsustainable and, once started, it is difficult to phase out. Thus, \ninstead of using resources on trucking it was decided to use them for the improvement of water sources for \nlonger-term benefits to the communities.  \n \nHow we work \nAll International Federation assistance seeks to adhere to the Code of Conduct for the International \nRed Cross and Red Crescent Movement and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO's) in Disaster \nRelief and is committed to the Humanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards in Disaster Response \n(Sphere) in delivering assistance to the most vulnerable. \n \nThe International Federation\u2019s activities \nare aligned with its Global Agenda, which \nsets out four broad goals to meet the \nFederation's mission to \"improve the lives \nof vulnerable people by mobilizing the \npower of humanity\". \nGlobal Agenda Goals: \n\u2022 \nReduce the numbers of deaths, injuries and impact \nfrom disasters. \n\u2022 \nReduce the number of deaths, illnesses and impact \nfrom diseases and public health emergencies. \n\u2022 \nIncrease local community, civil society and Red Cross \nRed Crescent capacity to address the most urgent \nsituations of vulnerability. \n\u2022 \nReduce intolerance, discrimination and social exclusion \nand promote respect for diversity and human dignity. \nContact information  \nFor further information specifically related to this operation please contact:  \n\u2022 \nIn Eritrea: Sister Alganesh Kidane, Secretary General, Red Cross Society of Eritrea, Asmara; \nEmail: rcse6@gemel.com.er;  Phone +291.115.16.93; Fax+ 291.115.18.59 \n\u2022 \nIn \nEritrea: \nAhmed \nSuleman, \nFederation \nRepresentative, \nAsmara \nEmail: \nahmed.suleman@ifrc.org; Phone +291.115.05.50; Fax +291.115.18.59 \n\u2022 \nIn Kenya: Dr. Asha Mohammed, Federation Head of Eastern Africa Zone, Nairobi, telephone + \n254.20.283.51.24; fax + 254.20.271.27.77; email: asha.mohammed@ifrc.org  \n\u2022 \nIn Geneva: John Roche, Operations Coordinator for Eastern and Southern Africa regions, \ntelephone + 41.22.730.4400; fax: +41 22 730 0395; email: john.roche@ifrc.org \n \n<Final financial report below; click here to return to the title page> \nSelected Parameters\nReporting Timeframe\n2005/1-2008/4\nBudget Timeframe\n2005/1-2006/10\nAppeal\nM05EA002\nBudget\nAPPEAL\nAll figures are in Swiss Francs (CHF)\nReport 2005 - 2008\nM05EA002 - Eritrea: Drought\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies\nI.

It is \nthe world\u2019s largest humanitarian organization and its millions of volunteers are active in over 181 countries.  \nIn Brief \nAppeal No. 19/02; Operations Update No. 5; Period covered: August to October 2004; Revised Appeal coverage: \n84.7%; (Please click here to go directly to the Contributions List) \n \nAppeal history: \n\u2022 A first Appeal (21/2000) was launched on 22 August 2000 for CHF 2,268,146 for 12 months for 100,000 \nbeneficiaries. The final report was issued on 31 December 2002. \n\u2022 A second \u2013 related but separate Appeal (19/2002) \u2013 was launched on 15 July 2002 for CHF 899,000 for initially \n12 months (later extended ) for 65,000 beneficiaries. \n\u2022 A revised Plan of Action was presented in August 2004 to continue the programme until March 2005, supporting \n45,335 beneficiaries. \n\u2022 A new revised Appeal budget from July 2002 to March 2005 is CHF 2,249,198. \n\u2022 Disaster Relief Emergency Funds (DREF) allocated: N/A \nOutstanding needs: CHF 572,756 \n \nOperational Summary \nIn August 2004, the Federation revised the plan of action for the implementation of the current p\nroject and \nextended the operation time frame to March 2005, in order to provide more sustainable solutions to the problems \nfaced by Afghan refugees. In this extended period, the project basically aims four activities : \n\u00a7 \nMeeting the water needs of beneficiaries by continuing the water trucking operation, \n\u00a7 \nProviding refugees with permanent sources of water supply by constructing public water distribution \nstations, \n\u00a7 \nTeaching self-help skills to refugees through health education \n\u00a7 \nDeveloping a communication strategy by supporting the IRCS in building its capacities to work closely \nwith the beneficiary communities \n \nThe Federation believes that these approaches will make it possible to continue meeting the urgent needs of \nbeneficiaries in a fixed period, while providing them with a more sustainable water solution and an opportunity for \ntheir capacity building, thus, ensuring a smooth phase out of the project. However, the project implementation was \nrestricted by limited funds being available. Only the water trucking operation has been carried out in the reporting \nperiod in order to meet the water needs of beneficiaries. \n \nTo make a planned phase out of the project in March 2005, it is necessary to meet the outstanding funding needs \nas soon as possible, so that all activities which have been planned as part of the final exit strategy are pushed \nforward in accordance with the revised plan of action. \n \nOn 18 November 2004, ECHO announced allocation of EUR 150,000 to ensure at least partial implementation \nof the project aimed at the construction of public water distribution points. \nIran Drought: Support to Afghan Refugees; Appeal no. 19/02; Operations Update no. 5 \n \n2 \nFor further information specifically related to this operation please contact:  \n\u2022 \nMehrdad Eshraghi, Acting Director General of International Affairs Department, Iranian Red Crescent Society, Tehran; \nemail: intdep@rcs.ir; mobile:  98. 912 384 7050; tel: 98.21.8849 077/8808 155; fax: 98.21.884 9079 \n\u2022 \nMohammed Mukheir, Head of Delegation, Tehran; email: ifrcir05@ifrc.org; mobile: 98.912 314 4250; tel: 98.21.8890 \n567/8911 271; fax: 98.21.889 5346 \n\u2022 \nEvgeni Parfenov, Regional Desk Officer, Geneva; email: evgeni.parfenov@ifrc.org; tel: 41.22.730 4325; fax: \n41.22.733 0395 \n \nAll International Federation assistance seeks to adhere to the Code of Conduct and is committed to the Humanitarian \nCharter and Minimum Standards in Disaster Response in delivering assistance to the most vulnerable.  For support to or \nfor further information concerning Federation programmes or operations in this or other countries, or for a full description \nof the national society profile, please access the Federation\u2019s website at http://www.ifrc.org \n \nThe IRCS maintains a website (www.rcs.ir) both in English and Farsi which also provides the latest information, \noperational updates, reports, interviews and news on the Bam operation to the public. \n \nOperational Developments    \n \nIn August 2004, the Federation revised the plan of action for implementation of the current project with a view \nto provide more sustainable solutions to the problems faced by Afghan refugees  and extended the operation \ntime \nframe \nto \nMarch \n2005 \n(For \ndetails, \nplease \nsee \nthe \nOperations \nUpdate \nNo. \n4 \nat \nhttp://www.ifrc.org/cgi/pdf_appeals.pl?02/190204.pdf). The revised plan of action has been designed to provide \nfor a final phase out of the project and is aimed at: \n\u00a7 \nMeeting the water needs of beneficiaries by continuing the water trucking operation; \n\u00a7 \nProviding refugees with permanent sources of water supply by constructing public water distribution \nstations; \n\u00a7 \nTeaching self-help skills to refugees through health education; \n\u00a7 \nDeveloping a communication strategy by supporting the IRCS in building its capacities to work closely \nwith the beneficiary communities. \n \nThe IRCS and the Federation started implementing the project in August 2004 with the fund remaining from the \nprevious appeal. However, due to the limited funds available, only the water trucking operation has been carried \nout in the reporting period in order to meet the water needs of beneficiaries. To increase the frequency of the \nwater trucking service, 3 water collection points are now under construction.  \n \nCoordination    \n \nThe IRCS and the Federation have been carrying out this operation in close cooperation with provincia l \nauthorities. The Zahedan Public Health Department is in charge of the chlorination of water and is providing \nregular information on the general drought situation in the region, the on-going water supply project and prospects \nfor the future. In Zabul, regular meetings are held with the local water department to facilitate water collection and \ndistribution. In addition, coordination meetings are being held at the field level between the Iranian Red Crescent \nSociety (IRCS), the Federation, United Nations agencies and MSF. Efforts are being made to coordinate the \nhumanitarian assistance for Afghan refugees with United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), \nwhich is responsible for implementation of the voluntary repatriation of these people.  \n \nRed Cross and Red Crescent action \n \nThe IRCS and the Federation have been implementing this project since August 2000, in order to support Afghan \nrefugees. At the beginning, the project focused on meeting the urgent water needs of beneficiaries, giving them \nbasic health care education and ensuring sanitation in residential areas. In the new phase of the operation that \nIran Drought: Support to Afghan Refugees; Appeal no. 19/02; Operations Update no. 5 \n \n3 \nbegan in August 2004, the focus has shifted to providing more sustainable solutions to the problems faced by the \nrefugees while continuing to meet their daily water needs.  \n \nRed Cross and Red Crescent Society \n \nThe Sistan-Baluchistan provincial branch is in charge of the implementation of the project in Zahedan and Zabul. \nIn the course of implementation of the project over the past several years, the staff and volunteers who have been \nengaged in it have increased their project management capacity. This is quite visible in narrative and financial\n \nreporting, internal monitoring system, and clear responsibilities and duties of the staff involved in the project. \n \nObjectives, activities and results \n \n1. Beneficiaries have better access to water through the improvement of the water trucking system and \nconstruction of a permanent water supply system \n \nAt present, approximately 5 percent (2,355 people) of the whole beneficiaries are living in villages of Zabul and \nthe remaining 95 percent (43,000) in the out skirts of Zahedan. To continue distributing safe clean water to the \nbeneficiaries in these regions, the IRCS is using a fleet of 11 trucks and 22 water tanks (10 mobile and 12 fixed) in \nZahedan and 3 trucks and 6 water tanks in Zabul.  \n \nWater delivery is going well and smoothly, without any considerable problem. Water trucks are going around \nvillages once or twice a day to fill the tanks with water. Beneficiaries come to the tanks with empty jerry cans to \nfetch water. They get water six days a week without interruptions and are satisfied with both the quality and the \nquantity of the water delivered by the project. On average, a beneficiary gets 10 litres of water per day. \n \nIn order to reduce the water-filling time of beneficiaries, small water taps and pipes attached to tanks have been \nreplaced with bigger-size taps and pipes. Besides, 12 drainage wells were dug next to the fixed water tanks in \nZahedan to ensure sanitation in the areas near these tanks.  \n \nTable 1.

The IRCS signed a \ncontract with the city water department in this regard and selected the sites where they will be built. The water \ndepartment i\ns now in the process of procuring necessary equipment for the construction, which is expected to be \ncompleted in November. \n \nThe construction of 4 public water distribution stations in residential areas of Afghan refugees has not begun until \nrecently, due to the absence of the required funds. However, on 18 November 2004, ECHO announced allocation of \nEUR 150,000 which will allow to implement the construction of three stations.  \n \n2. Afghan refugees have increased their capacity to deal with health-related issues by themselves \n \nActivities planned to achieve this objective include: \n\u2022 \nProviding Traditional Birth Attendant training for 20 Afghan women. \n\u2022 \nEducating 15,000 refugees in primary health care, environmental health, family health, disease \n        prevention and hygiene. \n\u2022 \nTraining 60 Afghan men and women as skilled community health workers. \n\u2022 \nDistributing public awareness materials among beneficiaries. \n \nRelated to the above, nothing has been done in the reporting period as no fund is available to support these \nactivities.  \n \nRed Cross and Red Crescent Movement -- Principles and Initiatives    \n \nThe operation mainly targeted Afghan refugees living in non-camp settlements, who do not have access to clean \nwater and sanitation facilities, and most of whom are not officially inhabited in Iran and therefore can not qualify \nfor any work. IRCS and the Federation played an important role in advocating the need for the provision of \nassistance to the refugees jointly with UNHCR and the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC). The \nvulnerable Iranian population living in these same areas were also included in this operation, thereby ensuring a \nbalance in the provision of assistance and adherence to the criterion of vulnerability as the most important one in \nidentifying target groups.  \n \nGiven the central role of female beneficiaries in the maintenance of households, including the use of water and \nfamily hygiene, the IRCS and the Federation have tried to involve them as much as possible. Women were \nconsulted in the design of water collection points and public water distribution stations and they were also \nrecruited to supervise and administer water distribution from fixed water tanks.  \n \nNational Society Capacity Building \n \nThe Sistan-Baluchistan Provincial Branch of the IRCS maintains its technical and human resources capacity \nstrengthened during the course of this project. IRCS staff and volunteers trained within the framework of the \nproject continue to work for its implementation and IRCS project coordinators and field officers perform a high-\nIran Drought: Support to Afghan Refugees; Appeal no. 19/02; Operations Update no. 5 \n \n5 \nlevel of responsibility within the programme. Technical assistance from the Federation Delegation in terms of \nplanning, response and financial reporting according to Federation procedures and standards contributes to \nbuilding on the capacity of the branch in respective areas.  \n \nFederation Delegation \n \nThe Federation delegation is assisting the IRCS in the overall operational management, by coordinating donor \nresponse, monitoring the implementation and providing technical assistance to IRCS in capacity building with a \nfocus on planning, monitoring and evaluation of programs, facilitation in the strengthening of human and financial\n \nresources and standardization of procedures. A Federation programme officer was newly recruited in September \nand based in Zahedan. He is in charge of daily supervision, monitoring, and coordination of activities with the \nIRCS provincial branch, as well as data collection - including information on weather conditions, health statistics, \nrepatriation process and other information necessary for the evaluation of the impact of the operation on the most \nvulnerable. \n \nAdvocacy/Public Information    \n \nEfforts were made to advocate the needs and rights of the target population. Embassies, UN agencies, ECHO and \ninternational organizations were contacted to draw their attention to the needs of beneficiaries. Issues concerning \ntheir assistance were also discussed with local authorities, UNHCR and non\u2013governmental organisations present \nin the region. Local and international media are active in follow-up of the drought situation in the region, as well \nas regarding issues of water distribution between Afghanistan and Iran.  \n \nOutstanding needs    \n \nThe project implementation was restricted by limited funds available. Of the planned activities, only the water \ntrucking operation has been carried out in the reporting period in order to meet the water needs of beneficiaries. \nOther activities such as the construction of public water distribution stations and health education were not \nundertaken owing to the lack of funds. \n \nTo make a planned phase out of the project in March 2005, it is necessary to meet the outstanding funding needs \nas soon as possible , so that all activities which have been planned as part of the final exit strategy are pushed \nforward in accordance with the revised plan of action. \n \n \n \nPlease click here to return to the title page and contact information \n"

For more information: www.ifrc.org  \nIn Brief \nAppeal coverage: 43.5%; see attached Contributions List or see the Federation\u2019s website at: \nhttp://www.ifrc.org/cgi/pdf_appeals.pl?03/1-2-3%20-%20ap1703.pdf  \nOutstanding needs: CHF 655,144 (USD 463,300  or EUR 426,100) \nRelated  Emergency or Annual Appeals:   \n\u2022 \nSudan 2003 Annual Appeal no. 01.10/2003 \n\u2022 \nSudan: Floods in Kassala State; Emergency Appeal  no. 19/2003 \nOperational Summary: The food security situation in Sinkat and Halayeb remains critical. Food \ndistribution is being conducted by WFP. Since food stocks were limited, only 50% rations were provided \nin the first cycle conducted from 26 June to 18 July.  The situation has not improved and the second cycle \nplanned for 23 August could not take place. WFP may divert stocks meant for Toka to Hayaleb before the \nend of September but again consisting of only half rations. Shelter remains a high priority as no \nprocurement has been done. Through funding received from Danish Red Cross, procurement is expected \nto commence soon. There is an acute shortage of water in Sinkat and Halayeb provinces. The situation is \nexpected to improve through the rehabilitation of 20 wells, drilling of 15 new ones and protection of 20 \nothers as soon as funding from German Red Cross is received by the Red Sea Branch. No health outreach \nservices have been provided as there are no funds earmarked for this activity.    \n \nOperational developments \nThe Red State in Eastern Sudan has been experiencing recurring drought from the mid 80s; these have \nbecome prolonged and more severe since 2000 threatening the very livelihood of about 54% of the rural \npopulation in Sinkat and Halayeb Provinces. The Red Sea State Branch of the Sudanese Red Crescent \ncontributes significantly to addressing the needs of the vulnerable population from the drought. \n \nSudan: Drought; Emergency Appeal no. 17/03; Operations Update no. 1 \n \n \n2 \nFollowing an assessment by the Sudanese Red Crescent in collaboration with the Federation, an appeal \nworth CHF 1,159,000 was launched on 1 July 2003 to provide 106,500 beneficiaries with both food and \nnon food items. Part of the appeal also aimed to contribute to improving the capacity of the Sudanese Red \nCrescent and the affected local community to respond to the impact of the chronic drought in the Red Sea \nState, however, nothing has been done in this respect due to non availability of funds. \n  \nRed Cross and Red Crescent action  \n \nOverall objective: to meet the immediate humanitarian needs of 106,500 highly vulnerable people and \nto strengthen the capacity of the SRCS and the community through disaster preparedness and risk \nreduction measures addressing chronic food insecurity. \n \nObjective 1: To distribute full general food rations to 106,500 persons for a six-month period   \n \nProgress \nThe first cycle of food distribution consisting of a  50% ration was carried out in Sinkat and Halayeb \nprovinces from 26 June to 18 July 2003 to 106,000 beneficiaries; this included 15,000 internally displaced \npersons (IDPs) in Sinkat Province (see table below). World Food Programme (WFP) provided 1,712.42 MT \nof mixed food commodities for the distribution which was carried out by the Red Sea State Brach local \nrelief committees under the supervision of the Sudanese Red Crescent Disaster Preparedness officer and \nfour field officers. Five vehicles were used during the exercise.  \n \nFirst cycle \u2013 food distribution \nItem \nRation  \nDuration  \nCereals \n13.72 kg/person   \n61 days  \nPulses \n01.52 kg/person \n61 days  \nOil \n0.91 kg/person \n61 days  \n \nImpact \nAlthough the size of the ration was only half of the planned distribution, the food met the real need of \nbeneficiaries and helped in bridging the gap. It also helped stabilize the market prices which had shot up to \n35% while the number of livestock in the market has decreased and also there is a slight rise in livestock \nprices.  \n \nConstraints \nDue to difficulties experienced by WFP in view of limited availability of food supplies, only 50% of the \nfood requirements were met. The very high expectations form the vulnerable population is negatively \nimpacting the reputation of the Sudanese Red Crescent as lead agency in this crisis.   \n \nObjective 2: To distribute non-food Items (cooking utensils and blankets) and shelter materials to \n15,000 IDPs. \n \nProgress  \nAlthough the tendering process for the purchase of local shelter and construction materials was launched \nand a comparative bid analysis conducted, the items had not been purchased at the time of writing this \nreport. People are still living in very poor conditions, some accommodated by relatives in makeshift homes \nand exposed to the element.  \n \nImpact \nThe local health authorities have reported increased cases of acute respiratory infections among children \nand elderly people.  \nSudan: Drought; Emergency Appeal no. 17/03; Operations Update no. 1 \n \n \n3 \n \n \nConstraints \nNon-availability of funds has affected implementation of the planned activities. \n \nObjective 3: To construct, rehabilitate and protect select water points.  \n \nProgress \nThe priority areas have been identified and contact established with the local leaders and authorities. The \nformation of committees to manage the wells is underway. An application has been submitted to German \nRed Cross to fund the water project; follow up will be done from Khartoum with the German Red Cross \nRepresentative. \n \nImpact \nWater shortage is still a major problem and there is a high prevalence of waterborne diseases like diarrhea \nin Sinkat Province. Further delay in the implementation of the planned activities could have more serious \nconsequences on the livelihood of the affected communities  \n \nConstraints \nNo funds to date to implement the planned activities under this objective.  \n \nObjective 4:  To increase the access of 89,000 highly vulnerable people in Sinkat Province to outreach \nhealth services.  \n \nProgress \nUNFPA has expressed interest to support a Reproductive Health programme in the Red Sea State; a \nproposal currently under preparation will be completed at the end of September 2003. \n \nImpact \nThe health situation continues to deteriorate especially in the remote areas of North Sinkat, East Halayeb, \nand West Derudeb.  \n \nConstraints \nNo funds to date to implement the planned activities under this objective.  \n \nObjective 5:  To improve the capacity of the SRCS and communities affected by chronic food \ninsecurity in disaster preparedness, response and risk reduction. \n \nProgress \nNo activities have been implemented under this objective. However, the staff and volunteers from the Red \nSea State Branch have good experience in disaster response, resource mobilization and bilateral \nprogrammes from previous response to the chronic drought in the area.  \n \nImpact \nThe first cycle of food distribution was conducted relatively well using the existing capacity within the \nbranch.  \n \nConstraints \nNo funds have been made available to improve the capacity of the Red Sea State Branch in this respect. \n  \nSudan: Drought; Emergency Appeal no. 17/03; Operations Update no. 1 \n \n \n4 \nFederation coordination \nThe appeal was launched in collaboration with the Federation. The programme is being supported by the \nFederation Drought Program Coordinator at the field with support from the Federation Sudan Delegation \nand the technical departments of the Federation Regional Delegation in Nairobi. \n \nNational Society Capacity Building  \nThrough the operation, training has been provided to 50 volunteers in food distribution and monitoring; 23 \ntransport monitors have also been trained. Four State Branch Directors and the Red Sea State Disaster \nPreparedness officer participated in a Regional Food Security Training. The Disaster Preparedness officer \nalso participated in the Regional Disaster Response Team training. One staff member participated in a \ngender training workshop organized by WFP in Port Sudan. The Red Sea State Branch Director, Sinkat \nProject Manager, and the Sudanese Red Crescent Society headquarter staff attended a one month overseas \ntraining course on human rights and financial management. A national task force has been formed to deal \nwith drought relief operations. \n \nCommunications \u2013 Advocacy and Public Information \nA telephone conference was conducted with eight participating national societies; four (Danish, British, \nGerman and Japanese Red Cross Societies) have given positive response towards support of the operation. \nGood contact with the local media has also been maintained. Coverage of the Sudanese Red Crescent \nresponse to the drought led to the national society\u2019s appointment as lead agency in the operation.  \n \nFor further information please contact:  \n \n\u2022 Mohammed Taha Osman, Sudanese Red Crescent, Port Sudan; Email srcsredsea@hotmail.com, Phone \n249 311 22083,  Fax  249 311 24447.   \n\u2022 Omer Osman Mahamoud, Secretary General, Sudanese Red Crescent Society, Khartoum; Email \nsrcs@sudanet.org, Phone  249 11 784889, Fax 249 11 772877 \n\u2022 Ken Baker, Federation Head of Sudan Delegation, Khartoum;  Email: ifrcsd02@ifrc.org , Phone 249 \n11 277 10 33, Fax 249 11 277 04 84 \n\u2022 Josse Gillijns, Federation Regional Officer, Geneva; Email: josse.gillijns@ifrc.org , Phone 41 22 730 \n42 24, Fax 41 22 733 03 95  \n \nAll International Federation assistance seeks to adhere to the Code of Conduct and is committed to the \nHumanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards in Disaster Response (SPHERE Project) in delivering \nassistance to the most vulnerable. \n \nFor support to or for further information concerning Federation programmes or operations in this or other \ncountries, please access the Federation website at http://www.ifrc.org. \n \nSudan - drought\nANNEX 1\nAPPEAL No. 17/2003\nPLEDGES  RECEIVED \n24/09/03\nDONOR\nCATEGORY\nQUANTITY\nUNIT\nVALUE CHF\nDATE\nCOMMENT\nCASH \nTOTAL COVERAGE\nREQUESTED IN APPEAL CHF ---------------------------------------->\n1,159,000\n43.5%\nBRITISH - RC\n15,000\nGBP\n33,360\n25.07.03\nGERMAN  - GOVT\n205,290\nEUR\n315,633\n10.09.03\nJAPANESE - RC\n28,100\nUSD\n37,963\n17.07.03\nSWEDISH - GOVT\n700,000\nSEK\n116,900\n04.09.03\nSUB/TOTAL RECEIVED IN CASH\n503,856\nCHF\n43.5%\nKIND AND SERVICES (INCLUDING PERSONNEL)\nDONOR\nCATEGORY\nQUANTITY\nUNIT\nVALUE CHF\nDATE\nCOMMENT\nSUB/TOTAL RECEIVED IN KIND/SERVICES\n0\nCHF\n0.0%\nADDITIONAL TO APPEAL BUDGET\nDONOR\nCATEGORY\nQUANTITY\nUNIT\nVALUE CHF\nDATE\nCOMMENT\nSUB/TOTAL RECEIVED\n0\nCHF\n"

Donors are encouraged to maintain the interest in and\nsupport for this operation. \nOutstanding needs: CHF 51,414,982\nRelated Appeals:  Southern Africa 2002 Annual Regional Appeal no. 01.16/2002\nAppeal coverage: 42.4%\nIN BRIEF\nOperational Developments w\nThe Zambian Red Cross Society with support from the Federation\nis preparing to distribute supplementary rations of beans through\nthe Society\u2019s Integrated Home Based Care programmes in\nLivingstone, Maamba and Kapiri Mposhi. Following the execution\nof a Letter of Understanding with the World Food Programme\u2019s\n(WFP) office in Lesotho, the Lesotho Red Cross Society began\ngeneral food distributions of WFP donated food items in the\nMokhotlong district on 30 September. The Malawi and Baphali\nSwaziland Red Cross Societies are continuing ongoing food\ndistributions of WFP donated food items. \nWith the planting season having begun the Federation and\nParticipating National Societies (PNS) working in Southern\nAfrica are concentrating on assisting those National Societies\nwhich as part of the appeal have plans to distribute agricultural\nstarter packs (seeds,tools and fertilizer) with finalizing their\ndistribution plans. The beginning of the rainy season which ranges from October through December,\ndepending on the exact location, will have a significant impact on the operation\u2019s planned activities. In terms\nof any sort of agricultural activities, it is critical to begin planting as soon as possible in order to derive the\nZambia Red Cross, Health Programmes officer\nwith malnourished children (distended abdomens)\nin Kapiri Mposhi.\nmaximum benefits from the rainy season. Timely planting is especially urgent this year as meteorologists are\npredicting a shortfall of rain during January and February. Planned water and sanitation activities involving\nconstruction in those areas which are subject to heavy rains will not be able to begin until after the rainy\nseason as the sloppy conditions are unconducive for digging. The Transport Support Package (TSP) will play a\nkey role during the rainy season as many of the areas identified by the WFP and its implementing partners for\nfood distributions become inaccessible for ordinary vehicles and trucks during the rainy season because of the\nmuddy conditions. The M6 trucks which are able to carry a high amount of tonnage through what are\nordinarily unpassable roads will make the delivery of urgently needed food assistance possible to otherwise\nisolated areas.    \nAccording to the latest information following recent assessments of Southern Africa, the WFP announced that\nthe number of people requiring food aid is continuing to rise and is expected to reach some 14.4 million\npeople. Zambia and Zimbabwe have seen the largest increase of\npeople in need of assistance. \nRed Cross and Red Crescent action w\nZAMBIA\nOBJECTIVE 1: GENERAL FOOD DISTRIBUTION \nTo ensure secure transportation of food from main warehouse to\ndesignated distribution points and ensure the timely and fair\ndistribution to targeted households.\nThe Zambian Red Cross Society (ZamCross) is one of thirteen\nWorld Food Programme (WFP) implementing parteners in\nZambia. In an agreement signed between the WFP and ZamCross\nduring the first week of August, ZamCross agreed to distribute\nWFP supplied food commodities in the country\u2019s Northwestern\nProvince to some 7,012 beneficiaries in Chavuma and some\n14,151 beneficiaries in Zambezi. Both Zambezi and Chavuma\nsuffered extensive crop damage following unusually heavy rainfall\nwhich destroyed last season\u2019s crops, and are difficult to access\nduring the rainy season when roads become to muddy for most\ntrucks and vehicles. General food distributions of WFP donated food items were scheduled to begin in early\nAugust before the rainy season, however, these distributions have been suspended since 19 August due to the\nZambian government\u2019s apprehensions about distributing genetically modified (GM) maize and pulses. The\nZambian government has sent a team of scientists on a fact finding mission to further research the issue. At the\nmoment, WFP implementing partners have been able to carry out limited distributions in Southern districts\nwhich are desperately in need of assistance, but the WFP and its implementing partners are awaiting further\ninformation regarding broader food distributions. ZamCross relief teams in the affected areas have been\norganized by the national society, and are prepared to commence the general distributions once food items\nbecome available from the WFP.\n   \nThe WFP has requested that implementing partners such as the ZamCross are sensitive to gender issues when\ndistributing food items and ensure that female heads of households receive their intended rations.\nZamCross is working with the Federation to ensure that ongoing long term activities to strengthen and support\nZamCross\u2019s development are not sidelined by the relief activities. During the last week of September\ninterviews and selection of ZamCross relief coordinators took place at the Society\u2019s national headquarters in\nLusaka. The Society\u2019s relief coordinators will work on district level and ensure that current staff involved with\nongoing health and water and sanitation projects are not overburdened. The ZamCross relief coordinators will\nwork with partners such as the WFP and the Federation on activities such as the planning of and monitoring of\ndistributions.      \nTRANSPORT SUPPORT PACKAGE (TSP) FOR WFP IN ZAMBIA \nAppeal no. 12/02; Southern Africa: Food Aid and Humanitarian Assistance                                                      operations update no. 9\n2\nZambia Red Cross worker and beneficiary\nOne hundred and sixteen TSP M6 trucks intended for use by the WFP in Zambia are still in Durban, however\nover the reporting period, the WFP informed the Federation that they are ready for the trucks to be moved as\nscheduled to Zambia. \nOnce the trucks are in Zambia decisions on how and where the trucks will be used are made by the WFP\u2019s\ncountry office in Zambia. The WFP\u2019s in country logistics unit is responsible for coordinating requests for\ntransport submitted by the organization\u2019s thirteen implementing partners. Once requests are received, they are\nreviewed taking into account two main factors 1) tonnage of food items to be distributed; and, 2)accessability\nand infrastructure of the district. Priority is then given to those organizations distributing larger amounts of\nfood and/or those organizations bringing food items to difficult to reach areas. The WFP logistics unit in\nZambia plans to provide each district with at least one truck.\nMaintenance of the trucks is coordinated by the Federation\u2019s transport coordinator and fleet manager who are\nresponsible for organizing the use and maintenance of the fleet with WFP\u2019s logistics unit in Johannesburg and\neach of the operating countries. The training of drivers conducted by the Federation\u2019s TSP technical delegates\nwill be very important in Zambia where most of the qualified drivers are unfamiliar with M6 trucks. The\nFederation\u2019s fleet manager in cooperation with the WFP is responsible for establishing maintenance systems\nfor the trucks in Zambia this includes activities such as identifying fuel suppliers and support for maintenance.\n \nOBJECTIVE 2: TARGETED FOOD DISTRIBUTION \nTo ensure that HIV/AIDS infected and affected people and malnourished children under five years have access\nto nutritious food supplements.\nThe Zambia Red Cross Society (ZamCross) has planned targeted food distributions of beans for the existing\nclient base of the Society\u2019s Integrated Home Based Care Project (HBC) in six districts where the Society has\nongoing HBC activities. Following the success of the Zimbabwe Red Cross Society\u2019s HBC project, ZamCross\nwith cooperation of the Federation\u2019s regional delegation in Harare\nintroduced the Integrated HBC project in three communities in\nLivingtone in 2001. The project was then extended to three\ncommunities in Maamba situated in the Southern province, and\nmost recently in May 2002 to Kapiri Mposhi situated in central\nZambia. The Integrated HBC project has three components. The\nkey component of the project is care giving for bed ridden and\nterminally ill patients. ZamCross also as part of its integrated HBC\nproject conducts activities involving peer education for youth, and\ncare for orphans.   \nAll of the areas where ZamCross\u2019 Integrated HBC project was\ninitiated are areas with a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS. The reason\nfor this is that these towns are all located in areas where a great\ndeal of commercial transit takes place. Truck drivers are prone to\nhave multiple relationships and transactional sex is becoming\nincreasingly more common in areas frequented by truck drivers.\nKapiri Mposhi, is located on the highway frequented by trucks\ntransporting goods to Tanzania. Livingstone which is situated on the Zimbabwe border sees a lot of traffic and\nas Maamba is a mining town trucks transporting coal are constantly coming in and going out. The incidents of\ntransactional sex have increased as many businesses have closed and food has become unavailable. The\nincrease in transactional sex increases the likelihood of the transmission of the HIV/AIDS virus. The capacity\nfor testing for HIV/AIDS in Zambia is very limited and many of those people who are HIV positive are\nunaware of their status thus many of the people engaging in transactional sex could be completely unaware that\nthey are being exposed to or transmitting the virus. ZamCross\u2019s Integrated HBC project through activities such\nas peer education and the HBC is working on educating the public about health risks posed by transactional\nsex which has increasingly become one of the main coping mechanisms for those in need of food. \nZamCross is also aware of the risks of conducting a food distribution in areas where transactional sex is\ncommon place. As has been mentioned in earlier operations updates the WFP and all of the implementing\npartners are making best efforts to prevent the abuse of power. To this end, at the end of September\nAppeal no. 12/02; Southern Africa: Food Aid and Humanitarian Assistance                                                      operations update no. 9\n3\nWater is becoming increasingly scarce --an\nHBC care facilitator and the Zambia Red Cross\nhealth programmes officer showed us the drying\nup water sources.\nZamCross\u2019s disaster and relief programmes officer attended a training regarding the prevention of the abuse of\npower and the spread of HIV/AIDS. The training was a two day Training of Trainers workshop conducted by\nUNICEF in Lusaka. Participants of the training received a manual, diskette and handouts. Having participated\nin the training, ZamCross\u2019s disaster and relief programmes officer will be responsible for coordinating the\ntraining of all staff and volunteers involved with distributing relief items.   \nThe HBC is run by the local branches in the districts where it is operating. ZamCross HBC activities receive\ntechnical support and advice from ZamCross\u2019s HIV/AIDS and health programmes officers in Lusaka. Projects\nalso receive support on the branch level from the branch\u2019s executive committee which includes a health\nadvisor and a health sub-committee. The teams of HBC care facilitators work closely with \u201ccoaches\u201d who are\nresponsible for training HBC care facilitators and monitoring both the work of the care facilitators and the\nprogress of the project\u2019s beneficiaries. \nSelection of the care facilitators takes place in close consultation with the community. ZamCross branches\napproach prominent community members such as civic and religious leaders to sensitize them about the\nexisting health problems in the community and the need to address them. From there representatives of\nZamCross discuss with the communities the qualities of a good caregiver, and how to identify who would be\nan appropriate caregiver by looking into someone\u2019s background and experience. Once the community puts\nforth candidates it is then up to ZamCross , who have created standardized guidelines for the HBC programme,\nto convey the appropriate selection criteria to the community leaders. Once appropriate candidates are selected\nfrom the community they undergo one month of training conducted by ZamCross. The training was developed\nfor ZamCross by the society with support from the Federation and the Zimbabwe Red Cross. ZamCross HBC\ncare facilitators receive incentives for their work such as continued training, shoes and bicycles for\ntransport.On average each care facilitator works three days a week and looks after ten families. ZamCross\nHBC care facilitators comprise both men and women. \nBeneficiary selection is also done in close consultation with the community. The ZamCross HBC care project\ntargets families as opposed to individuals. The reason for this is that it is not sufficient to only assist the family\nmember who is sick, but rather it is important to support the primary care givers as well. Clients are identified\nin three stages. First the community is made aware that the HBC care facilitators are available and are asked to\nadvise the care facilitators of who requires assistance. Then the coaches, who are health professionals, go to\nverify the care facilitator\u2019s selection. The coach then presents their findings to the ZamCross project officer.\nOnce approved the client is then registered into the main project register at the main project office.   \nIn Kapiri Mposhi, for example, ZamCross\u2019 HBC activities are closely linked with the District hospital where\nthe project has established its main office. The HBC activities in Kapiri Mposhi began in May 2002, prior to\nthe formation of the branch and the initiation of the HBC project Red Cross activities in the district were more\nscattered and limited to education about First Aid. In January of 2002, the branch became more structured and\na new president was selected. In May the Kapiri Mposhi HBC project had some 105 clients, five months later\nthe number of clients is close to three hundred. People living in Kapiri Mposhi have limited access to health\ncare facilities and the project has received positive feedback from local government officials who have\napproached the branch about extending their activities into other areas. The Kapiri Mposhi branch is also\nworking with other NGOs such as MSF. The branch through its HBC activities has conducted some minor\nfood distributions, however these had to be stopped due to a lack of funding.  \n \n\u009f\nBAPHALI SWAZILAND RED CROSS SOCIETY\nAccording to the most recent findings of the Vulnerability Assessment Committee (VAC), the Highveld, which\nup until now did not require assistance, is now facing serious food shortages. \n \nOBJECTIVE 1: GENERAL FOOD DISTRIBUTION  \nTo ensure a continuous support of approximately 45,000 beneficiaries for a period of four months with basic\nfood items.\nThe Baphali Swaziland Red Cross Society (BSRCS) carried out their second phase of distributions of WFP\ndonated food items in Hhohho, Manzini and Shiselveni. Monthly WFP rations per person comprises; 12 kg\nyellow maize; 1.8 kg pulses and 750 ml of cooking oil. The breakdown of beneficiaries by area for BRCS\ngeneral food distributions are:\nAppeal no. 12/02; Southern Africa: Food Aid and Humanitarian Assistance                                                      operations update no. 9\n4\n\u009f\nNorthern Hhohho; 7,325 beneficiaries .\n\u009f\nManzini; 8,013 beneficiaries (832 households).\n\u009f\nShiselveni; 4,625 beneficiaries (507 households).\nIn addition to distributing WFP donated food items, the BSRCS carried out an additional distribution of food\nitems to some 5,000 beneficiaries in Manzini. The distribution was made as a result of the BSRCS\u2019\nidentification of a greater need in Manzini than the WFP was able to support. The ration distributed is modeled\non the WFP ration. Distributions took place on 23 and 24 September. \nThe work of the BSRCS has been well appreciated by the beneficiaries and the WFP. The WFP\u2019s country\noffice in Swaziland has approached the BSRCS about extending their activities into an additional zone in\nShiselveni. The Society in cooperation with the WFP is currently redesigning their budget to accommodate the\nadditional distribution costs.\nOBJECTIVE 2: TARGETED FOOD DISTRIBUTION \nTo provide nutritious food supplements to the under-fives and to people infected and affected by HIV/AIDS.\nThe BSRCS will run a Training if Trainers course to prepare trainers to teach communities about nutrition\nand how best to use the nutritional supplements that the society will distribute.\n\u009f\nLESOTHO\nOBJECTIVE 1:  GENERAL FOOD DISTRIBUTION \nTo ensure secure transportation of food from the main warehouse to distribution points, and to ensure timely\nand fair distribution to the targeted households.\nRelief Training: Fifty Lesotho Red Cross Society (LRCS) volunteers participated in a three and a half day\nrelief training course arranged by the LRCS in the Mokhotlong district from 14-17 September. The programme\nincluded: the history and principals of the Red Cross/Red Crescent movement; and, the methodology for\nregistration, assessments, establishing distribution points,reporting etc. The training included a field exercise in\nwhich all the participants went out to surrounding villages to practice registering beneficiaries. The WFP\nDeputy Director made a brief presentation on practical matters of the food distribution i.e. selection criteria,\nmonthly rations etc. \nBoth genders and a broad age range were well represented among the participants. Many of the volunteers are\nLRCS youth and general members and some have prior experience with relief operations. Many of the\nvolunteers displayed their keen interest in the operation by actively participating in the training. Twelve LRCS\naction teams, averaging four volunteers each, have been formed following the training.\nWFP Food Distribution: In accordance with a priority list of distribution points planned by the DMA (the\ngovernment\u2019s coordinating body), the first LRCS distribution of WFP donated food items will begin on 30\nSeptember. Some LRCS action teams were already sent to villages to verify the list of beneficiaries, which was\nprepared by the DMA. The LRCS signed the operational agreement with WFP. The project time frame for now\nis nine months up to the end of June 2003. WFP is targetting approximately 8,000 households in Mokhotlong\ndistrict where the LRCS is distributing food items. The first food distribution will take place at three\ndistribution points. The Federation\u2019s relief delegate will travel to the field for monitoring.\nTwo staff will be employed to strengthen the LRCS\u2019s relief capacity for the Food Security Operation. A relief\nofficer will be responsible for the operation in the district.\nFollowing the confirmation of funding from the German Red Cross to support activities in Lesotho, work will\nbegin on procuring a six month supply of food items (maize, beans and oil.) Items will be purchased in South\nAfrica as it is the primary source of food items for Lesotho.\nTRANSPORT SUPPORT PACKAGE FOR WFP\nThe Federation\u2019s fleet manager was in Lesotho for two days to establish maintenance systems for the TSP\ncomponents (25 trucks etc.) based in Lesotho. \nAppeal no. 12/02; Southern Africa: Food Aid and Humanitarian Assistance                                                      operations update no. 9\n5\nNON-FOOD AND SUPPLEMENTARY RATION DISTRIBUTIONS \nLRCS bilateral activities with the German Red Cross Society (GRC).  \nThe LRCS is working with the GRC on constructing a plan of action for the distribution of seeds, agricultural\ntools, and food items. At the moment the LRCS is considering targeting the Mokhotlong district for\ndistributions of seeds and basic agricultural tools as the district was one of the most severely affected, and\nalthough the Ministry of Agriculture is providing seeds and fertilizer on a loan basis, there are no organisations\ncurrently conducting free distributions of agricultural relief items. Also of note, the local LRCS branch seems\nto have the greatest capacity in the Mokhotlong district to successfully carry out this sort of operation. Other\nagencies carrying out similar activities include the FAO who announced their plans to target three districts in\nthe southern part of country for free seeds distribution. The LRCS is preparing a proposal for additional GRC\nrelief activities targetting orphans, and HIV/AIDS affected persons for seed distributions.\n       \nOBJECTIVE 4: CAPACITY BUILDING  \nTo strengthen the operational capacity of the LRCS to respond to the food insecurity situation.   \nTwo vehicles for Lesotho were procured locally and are currently being registered.\n\u009f\nZIMBABWE\nOBJECTIVE 1: TARGETED FOOD DISTRIBUTION  \nTo ensure that HIV/AIDS infected and affected people and malnourished children under 5 years have access to\nnutritious food supplements.\nWork has been done on identifying a ration, or a set of rations, based on reference to a number of standards\nincluding WFP, Sphere and taking into account the rations of other agencies such as Save the Childrens Fund\n(SCF). One principle of the proposed ration is that the Society\u2019s Home Based Care (HBC) client base requires\na food parcel that is greater than that distributed normally; 20% higher in protein and 50% higher in energy.\nNegotiations continue with WFP related to issues on implementing partner status. This would greatly reduce\nthe complexity of the operation\u2019s logistics. It should be noted however that gaps in the WFP pipeline would\nneed to be met from the proposed buffer stock which is currently not funded.\nMeasuring the impact of food distributions to targeted beneficiaries is going to be a challenge as \u201cstandard\u201d\nnutrition indicators can not be applied.\nA nutritionist with the British Red Cross has been working with Zimcross on identifying indicators for\nmonitoring and evaluating the impact of the food distribution to HBC clients and their families. The\nFederation\u2019s health coordinator is collaborating with the nutritionist on technical aspects of the work .\nThe current reporting format used by the HBC is being analyzed to see how the new indicators can be\nintegrated into the routine of the HBC care facilitators without putting too many demands on them.\nThe coordinators of the HBC programme have recognized that the monitoring and evaluation of the activities\nhave been on the weak side, and they welcome the introduction of tools which would enable them to better\nmonitor the programme. The outcome of the work in Zimbabwe will be shared with the coordinators in the\nregion.\nAs far as monitoring/evaluation of supplementary feeding targeted to children under five, the \u201cstandard\u201d\nindicators of weight/height, or weight/age will apply depending on the local set up. .\nOBJECTIVE 2: WATER AND SANITATION  \nTo improve the availability of safe water and sanitation to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of food\nprovision.\nZimCross, with assistance from the Federation, is responding to the acute cholera outbreak in Zaka District in\nthe Masvingo Province targeting some 27,000 beneficiaries. The prevalence to vulnerability in this province\nwas confirmed by the food security assessment, making it one of the focal areas for ZimCross activities. In\nAugust there were some 350 reported cholera cases. By the second week of September, however, the number\nof reported cases had according to the latest statistics nearly doubled due to the low emergency response.\nAppeal no. 12/02; Southern Africa: Food Aid and Humanitarian Assistance                                                      operations update no. 9\n6\nZimCross in collaboration with government bodies has assisted with water chlorination and establishing\nadequate health facilities while other organisations are mainly focusing on food assistance. \nA substantial response is necessary to address the current health and water and sanitation problems in Zaka\ndistrict as eighty-four percent of the district\u2019s population do not have access to safe drinking water and only\nfive percent have latrines for safe disposal of faeces. \nOver the next three months Zimcross will:\n\u009f\nconstruct 15 new water points. \n\u009f\nrehabilitate 7 existing ones. \n\u009f\nassist building at least 200 family latrines. \n\u009f\nand, provide a comprehensive training package for proper hygiene/sanitation practices.\nOBJECTIVE 5: NON-FOOD DISTRIBUTION \nEnsure that the HIV/AIDS affected beneficiaries have access to basic drugs, winter weather protection and\nmeans for income generation for a more dignified lifestyle.\nThe Federation\u2019s logistics unit in Johannesburg has commenced with tendering for basic hygiene items such as\npetroleum jelly, soap and towels. Suppliers are being approached both inside and outside of Zimbabwe. As\nmany of the beneficiaries have either lost their source of income or are too ill to work they are unable to\npurchase these simple but critical items for themselves. Items such as petroleum jelly are used to soothe skin\nconditions that are commonly associated with AIDS. \nIn addition, as the capacity exists to expand upon the originally planned activities seeds and fertilizer are being\nprocured by the Federation in Zimbabwe for agricultural activities which will be carried out within the\nframework of the appeal.\nTRANSPORT SUPPORT PACKAGE (TSP)FOR WFP\nPreparation of TSP for deployment w\nFollowing the execution of the Operational Partnership Agreement by the WFP and the Federation in\nJohannesburg and in Malawi, the WFP raised some questions regarding the TSP budget. Operating\nmechanisms need to be worked out between the parties as to how the WFP\u2019s country offices will submit its\nrequests for transport. In addition transport of vehicles overland and across borders has posed some challenges\nand set backs with customs clearance and vandalism and theft.  \nProgramme Coordination and Management w\nThe Operational Management & Coordination Centre (OMCC) in Johannesburg, South Africa w\nA \u201creal time evaluation\u201d of the operation is scheduled for the second two weeks in October. A four person\nteam comprised of an external consultant and representatives of the Red Cross/Red Crescent movement will\nconduct an initial review of how the operation is functioning so far and identify the operation\u2019s strengths and\npotential weaknesses. The team will begin in Johannesburg and will travel to selected operational areas.\nA meeting of the Secretary Generals or their appointed representatives of the operating Southern African\nnational societies took place in Johannesburg on 26 September. The purpose of the meeting was to have senior\nmanagement from the National Societies meet and exchange information between themselves and with\nrepresentatives of the Federation.\nOutstanding needs and the response to date w\nFunding for the operation has improved thanks to support received from the Finnish and German Red Cross\nSocieties. The Secretary General of the Icelandic Red Cross, accompanied by a film crew, was in\nJohannesburg and Malawi in preparation for a concerted fundraising campaign scheduled to begin in October.\nSome 3,000 volunteers have been recruited by the society for a door to door campaign to raise funds for the\noperation. The Japanese Red Cross Society (JRCS) is scheduled to visit Southern Africa during the middle of\nOctober in preparation for the Society\u2019s November fund-raising activities. The selection of Southern Africa for\nthe JRCS\u2019 fund-raising activities marks the first time the society has identified Africa as a beneficiary of these\nactivities. \nAppeal no. 12/02; Southern Africa: Food Aid and Humanitarian Assistance                                                      operations update no. 9\n7\nFor further details please contact: \n\u009f\nMartin Zak, Federation Head of Operations, Phone: 41 22 730 45 51;

Next Ops Update\nNo. 3  expected 15 December 2001  \n9 November 2001\nSri Lanka: Drought\nIn Summary: Rain has still not reached the most vulnerable areas of Hambantota district and the\nRed Cross continues to monitor other affected areas, in particular Moneragala and Ratnapura\ndistricts. If rain does not reach these areas this month the crisis will worsen. The Federation\ncontinues to appeal to donors so that it can scale up its response to families in need.\nOutstanding needs: CHF 62,317\nRelated Appeals:  South Asia regional appeals 01.33/01; Sri Lanka 01.39/01\nAppeal coverage: 87.4%\n\u201cAt a Glance\u201d\n \nOperational \nDevelopments:\nThe Sri Lanka Red Cross Society (SLRCS) has completed a second six-week distribution of food\nrations to 2,297 families in the Lunugamvehera and Suriyaweva Divisions and 1,419 families in\nHambantota Division.\nThis was possible thanks to contributions to the Federation from the Norwegian Government and the\nNorwegian Red Cross Society, the Canadian Red Cross Society, CORDAID and local contributions in\nSri Lanka. Rations have been maintained of rice, flour, dal and sugar for 45 days to each of the 3,500\nfamilies who have been individually assessed. Local Government agents who have attended all the Red\nCross drought relief distribution operations have continued to publicly thank the Red Cross for ensuring\nassistance for these families. \nThe second SLRCS distributions took place in three phases on 19, 20 and 21 October. It addressed\nfamilies in the Devuramvehera, Angunakolaweva, Pahalamattala, and Weerail Ara Gram Niladari (GN)\nDivisions of Lunugamvehera; Wediweva, Andaraweva and Mahawelikada Ara GN Divisions of\nSuriyaweva Division; and Bellagasweva, Galewa, Gonnoruwa, Elalla, Ketawnewa, and Keliyapura GN\nDivisions of Hambantota Division in Hambantota District. \nVulnerability assessments of the 1,419 families Hambantota Division had taken place during October\nthrough further house to house surveys conducted by local Red Cross volunteers. The assessment\ncriteria had been modified and enlarged to continue to provide more detailed information about the\nwater and medical needs of the families as well. The potential changes to the survey form was also\ndiscussed with the Government AGA\u2019s office in Lunugamvehera to add their views on effective\nselection criteria for beneficiaries.\nThe national level interagency coordination forum initiated by the Federation has continued to meet to\nshare operational plans between responding UN and international NGO agencies. This has improved\ncoordination. For example, the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society and Save the Children Fund (UK) are\nworking together to enable SCF\u2019s water tankers to supply the most vulnerable families, who were\nsurveyed by Red Cross volunteers. The SCF (UK) has also donated a water bowser to the SLRCS for\nthree years to enable them to transport water to the most vulnerable families receiving food rations. The\nSLRCS will raise the funds for maintenance and transportation of the bowser (i.e. tractor hire costs)\nfrom local fund-raising. \nAnother example of coordination has been the discussions between the Federation and WFP about the\nlatter providing food supplies to the most vulnerable families identified by Red Cross surveys. These are\nfamilies who may not be able to benefit from the Government and WFP sponsored food for work\nprogrammes due to inability of family members to work (women-headed households, or those families\nwith disabled heads of household, for example).\nCoordination has continued with ICRC, which has assessed drought zones in conflict-affected parts\nadjoining the most affected parts of Ampara District. The assessment is spreading to include families\nfrom Moneragala and Ratnapura Districts whose Red Cross branches are following up surveys in areas\nalso reporting high levels of families in distress because of drought. \nRed Cross Red Crescent action w\nThe Sri Lanka Red Cross Society has continued to facilitate quality coverage of its drought relief\noperation, and therefore act as a source of information to other actors. The Society\u2019s Information\nOfficer accompanied electronic media and press journalists to the distribution programmes between\n19-21 October and a high level of interest and coverage was generated. There was senior level\nattendance by editors of national newspapers, and representatives from Sinhala and Tamil press, TV\nand Radio institutions. This resulted in TV coverage, and further high profile media articles.\nThe priority has continued to be to bring media coverage and attention to human interest stories\nhighlighting the plight of the most vulnerable families, particularly those living in interior areas away\nfrom main roads. These families have still not been assessed by any other agency. They have continued\nto miss the now declining number of ad hoc roadside distributions conducted by local NGOs and private\ncompanies donating goods. \nThe Federation has been asked to make a presentation on the drought to the UN\u2019s Donor Forum meeting\non 1 November, which will be a key opportunity to link the existing operation to longer term advocacy\nmessages on disaster preparedness and drought mitigation strategies. Meetings have also continued to\ntake place separately between the Federation and UN agencies such as WFP, as well as with the\nGovernment Secretary at the Ministry of Social Services, to ensure a sharing of all assessments and\nmaximisation of resources.\nRed Cross Society w\nappeal no. 25/2001: Sri Lanka: Drought\noperations update no. 2\n2\nThe Sri Lanka Red Cross Society national drought relief coordinator as well as the district level\nco-ordinator in Hambantota, the most affected district, have participated in a large number of meetings,\nincluding with the visiting Federation Relief Delegate. The aim was to modify and improve the survey\nassessment form used to identify the most vulnerable families in house to house surveys. \nOn 9 October the SLRCS national coordinator and Hambantota district branch secretary conducted a\ntraining for 53 volunteers (24 female and  29 male) from Lunugamvehera, Suriyaweva, and\nHambantota AGA Divisions. The purpose of the training workshop was to: learn from the first\nvulnerability assessment survey process; improve the survey questionnaire better screen and select the\nmost vulnerable families; and to plan the next assessment. Training was held at the NORAD Training\nCentre in Hambantota and involved role plays and small group discussions. The NORAD director and\nthe SLRCS branch secretary conducted sessions on communications skills and disaster preparedness. \nAfter this orientation meeting the 53 volunteers conducted the next phase of the survey, undertaking\nhouse to house visits between 10-16 October in the most affected areas of Galweva, Bellagasweva,\nKetanweva, Keliyapura, Gonnoruwa, and Elalla GN Divisions of Hambantota District. As before the\nsurvey was conducted in places inaccessible to many other agencies (remote areas away from the public\nhighways).\nDiscussions were held with the government agents in each affected district and division to cross check\nagainst government information so that the survey could identify the most vulnerable families.\nThe following are the details of the survey:\n1'419\n1'657\nTotal\n278\n312\nElalla\n229\n280\nGonnoruwa\n120\n144\nBellagasweva\n175\n210\nKeliyapura\n153\n201\nKetanweva\n464\n510\nGalweva\nSelected families\nNo. of  families surveyed\nGN Division\nAll families identified as the most vulnerable were, as before, given a personalised ration number and\ntold of the venue of the forthcoming food distribution. At the distribution itself the number was checked\nagainst the list of families identified, and the household representative\u2019s signature was confirmed  prior\nto the relief supplies being released.\nRelief distributions w\nObjectives and Activities planned \nThe overall goal of the SLRCS operation is to provide supplementary food support to the most\nvulnerable of those affected by the drought until the first harvest of crops due in January/February\n2002.\nRelief distributions\nThe earlier commitment to meet half of their food needs, as measured against Sphere minimum\nstandards of calorific intake, until the next harvest of the worst affected families continues. An\nassessment after the first distributions found that families were still managing to meet 50 percent of\ntheir food requirements based on the Sphere minimum nutritional standards and using locally acceptable\nstaples of rice, flour, dal and sugar. \nOn 9 October, SLRCS called for tenders to be able to purchase in phased instalments all the food items\nrequired for distributions to 3,500 families until the end of December 2001. In fact the total number of\nfamilies reached by these distributions is 3,716, due to the average size of family calculation of six\nappeal no. 25/2001: Sri Lanka: Drought\noperations update no. 2\n3\npersons per family not always being the exact number. Because some families have only three members,\nthe rations can reach a larger number.\nThe successful suppliers are two cooperative agencies, again providing pre-packaged, high quality local\ngoods. This also enables the cash to be recirculated into the local farmers\u2019 economy. Again, the\nsuppliers will include the costs of local transportation and delivery, saving SLRCS warehousing and\nother logistics costs, such as packaging. The distributions carried out on 19, 20 and 21 October were\nfurther divided into four village locations per AGA division to enable the community to have the rations\ndelivered directly to the villages. This has facilitated easy distribution via Red Cross volunteers from\ntrucks close to interior areas where most of the vulnerable families are located.\nDiscussions are under way between the Federation and the World Food Programme about whether the\nFederation and SLRCS can come to an agreement to distribute WFP food rations to the remaining\n2,785 families from the Federation\u2019s earlier total of 6,500 intended beneficiary families. Discussions are\ncontinuing and are dependent on the donor response to the WFP\u2019s own appeal that has just been\nlaunched from Rome.\nTable 1 - Continuing Original Food Requirements (Kgs) for 6 months\n105'300\n16.2\n2.7\n0.015\nSugar\n280'800\n43.2\n7.2\n0.04\nDal\n526'500\n81\n13.5\n0.075\nFlour\n877'500\n135\n22.5\n0.125\nRice\nTotal required for\n6,500 families for 6\nmonths\nTotal required/ 6\nperson family for\n6 months\nTotal Ration\n/person\nRation\nperson/day\n(Kgs) \nItem\nSpecific objectives and activities already conducted against these are as shown below:\nObjective 1: To provide one initial food distribution to 1,000 families in one district for 3 months\nutilising available disaster relief emergency funds (DREF) funds.\nActivity 1 : Personnel and trained disaster preparedness volunteers from SLRCS headquarters,\nHambantota district and divisional branches and a Federation delegate conducted a rapid assessment to\nidentify 1,000 of the most vulnerable families in one division. This was completed on time before the\nend of August and families received the full amount for 45 days of 25 kgs of rice, 20 kgs flour, 10 kgs\ndal, and 4 kgs sugar (for a six person family). The villages covered were Bogahaweva, Padavgama,\nDevranwehera, Ranawaranawa, Ilukpalassa, Una  Athweva, and Uda Mathala of Lunugamvehera\nDivision of Hambantota District.  \nThe full distribution was made to 1,293 families. Another 293 families could be accommodated as not\nall the most vulnerable families had six members on average, and those families with fewer members\nreceived reduced rations. This enabled the saved rations to be spread among a further 293 families.\nFor each house to house survey form the vulnerability criteria assessed by the Red Cross volunteers\nincluded main sources of income of households and how this income has been affected; what survival\nstrategies families used to find work, income and food and water. The form also included any family\nmembers currently employed; numbers of children in the 0-5, 5-12, and 12 and over age groups;\nmonthly income, including from government or non-governmental sources (e.g. Samurdhi assistance);\nsources of drinking water; details of pregnant and lactating mothers. Each survey form also contained\nthe verification signature of the Gram Niladari (Village Headman).\nActivity 2 : Procure and distribute food to the identified 1,000 families by first week in September.\nappeal no. 25/2001: Sri Lanka: Drought\noperations update no. 2\n4\nThe SLRCS tender process decided upon purchasing all food items for the distributions from the state\ncooperative agency as the quality was consistent and high, and pre-packaging arrangements saved on\nwarehousing and packaging costs. \nThe SLRCS organised a second distribution on 9 September to 962 families out of a total list of 1,055\nfamilies (with the balance being delivered within five days to those who did not attend the distribution\nitself). The families had been assessed through house to house surveys. They came from the villages of\nMaha Ara, Namadagasweva, Suriyaweva, 8th Mile Post, Beddavadiya, Andaragaswewa, Usgala from\nthree Divisions of Andarawewa, Mahawew Kada Ara, and Wediwewa. This distribution was conducted\nusing local donations of food items mobilised in Sri Lanka for the Red Cross Society from the public\nand business sector sources. In this second distribution, 832 families received the full six person ration\nfor 45 days and 223 received the reduced ration for smaller family sizes. \nObjective 2: To provide one food distribution to an additional 5,500 families and a second\ndistribution to all 6,500 families\nActivity 1: Personnel and trained disaster preparedness volunteers from SLRCS headquarters and\nHambantota district and Divisional branches conducted a second assessment to identify a further 1,419\nvulnerable families in the Hambantota division. The survey, conducted by 53 specially trained\nvolunteers, was completed between 10-16 October. However, after discussion with the Federation\ndisaster relief delegate, the local Federation delegation helped the SLRCS develop a plan of action to\nassist 3,500 of the most affected families for the next five months if the Appeal reaches 50 percent of its\ntarget. Identifying the most vulnerable beneficiaries has been improved to maximise the effective use of\navailable resources.\nThe budget for the total appeal was revised in October and the target number of beneficiary families\nwas reduced to 3,500 (subsequently increased to 3,716 due to the change in the average family size\nmaking more rations available to distribute). Committed donor funds have been identified to enable the\nFederation and SLRCS to support this number of families through the six month projected cycle.\nActivity 2 : Procure and distribute food to the 5,500 families identified, by mid-September.\nThe second distributions took place during the six week cycle from mid-October (a month later than\nscheduled because of the vulnerability assessment exercise and availability of funds). SLRCS used the\nsame procurement procedures as for the first distribution. The number of families was reduced to 3,716\nin line with funding projections for the full six-month distribution cycle.\n30 youth volunteers (17 male and 13 female), as well as the Red Cross Branch volunteer officials\nworked to distribute the rations on three consecutive days, ending at 3 am in some cases.\nActivity 3 : Repeat the procurement and distribution to the first 1,000 families after 45 days, and\nsubsequently to all 6,500 families in mid November.\nAs mentioned in Activity 2 - regarding the revised number of beneficiaries, and in keeping with the\nearlier action plan - the Federation and SLRCS maintained the six week ration distribution schedule for\nthe first two areas and added the first six week cycle in the most vulnerable areas of Hambantota\ndivision on 20 October. This will make the next six week distribution cycle due to start at the end of\nNovember. This is in order to take the most vulnerable families into a further six week cycle ending in\nmid-January, when harvesting begins enabling poor rural workers to earn income.\nHealth w\nThere were no specific health objectives in the original Appeal, but the Federation and SLRCS have\ncoordinated closely with other agencies and institutions that have agreed to assume a health monitoring\nrole. \nappeal no. 25/2001: Sri Lanka: Drought\noperations update no. 2\n5\nObjective 1\nTo establish regular exchange of assessment information with other government, UN and INGO\ninstitutions on the prevailing health trends in the affected areas as gathered through house to house Red\nCross surveys.\nActivity 1: Contribute to coordinated efforts to raise health issues with other institutions.\nThe Federation has convened a regular interagency meeting where sectoral issues can also receive more\ncoordinated attention. It has exchanged monitoring information with WHO, UNICEF, and INGOs such\nas SCF (UK), and World Vision. Assessments of morbidity trends, possible health promotion\ncampaigns, supplementary nutrition programmes for pregnant and lactating mothers and children under\n5 years old will continue. Other water and sanitation and hygiene related issues have been included in a\ncoordinated response, while the Red Cross focuses on food relief supplies. \nUNICEF and WFP have responded to health trend indicators by seeking to coordinate programmes for\nsupplementary nutritional feeding for pregnant and lactating mothers and children under 5 in the most\naffected areas. The Red Cross surveys have helped to identify which divisions have a higher percentage\nof potential beneficiaries in these categories.\nWater-sanitation w\nAlthough there were no specific water and sanitation related objectives in the original Appeal the\nFederation and Sri Lanka Red Cross have also decided to continue to assess future options, including\nfurther advocacy on behalf of those with limited access to water and other emergency provisions.\nSCF (UK) have provided SLRCS, and the Hambantota branch in particular, with a water bowser under\na memorandum of understanding for three years. This will help the branch (and other drought-affected\nbranches) with the opportunity to supplement water supplies to communities in need if they cannot\naccess adequate supplies from the government or other sources.\nObjective 1\nTo assess the water access issues and projections for supplies for the most vulnerable families through\nthe revised vulnerability assessment survey process.\nActivity 1: Use of the revised questionnaire to identify villages which have a chronic water shortage.\nThe new questionnaire asked families about their water sources. One outcome is that the new SCF\nprovided bowser will be used to provide those in most need with regular water (which meets Sphere\nminimum standards) from end of October\nNational Society Capacity Building w\nThe SLRCS has experience in relief operations and has a substantial number of available volunteers.\nMany of the younger volunteers have received valuable first time, as well as refresher training in\ndisaster preparedness and vulnerability capacity assessments. The SLRCS has also networked with\nother institutions and has used resource persons from agencies such as NORAD and Government to\nsupplement and widen the scope of their training.\nThe initial two distributions have already significantly increased the coordination, logistics and resource\nmobilisation skills not only of personnel in the NHQ and drought-affected branches, but also in\nbranches, such as Colombo which undertook widespread communications and fund-raising work, and\nfinally sent 40 volunteers to participate in the second food relief distribution itself on 9 September.\nThe SLRCS information officer has also increased her capacity to work with the media in a strategic\nway and, overall, the SLRCS response has helped it to understand the roles of advocacy more\nrealistically. As a result of each press release and effective community-based set of activities, the\nappeal no. 25/2001: Sri Lanka: Drought\noperations update no. 2\n6\nSLRCS has succeeded in keeping the drought issue in the forefront of the media and public\u2019s eye. It has\nalso improved its positioning as an effective relief and response institution with a wide range of actors.\nFederation Delegation w\nThe programme is being managed by the Federation representative in Sri Lanka, with the earlier\nassistance from a disaster relief delegate. The delegation has maintained close coordination with the\nSLRCS and with the ICRC delegation, which had deployed an agronomist to assess the areas in the\nconflict affected parts of Ampara District.\nThe responsibility for day to day monitoring of the operation will be with the SLRCS, primarily at\nbranch level but supervised closely by an officer at headquarters, specifically assigned to coordinate the\nproject. Daily coordination meetings are taking place between the Federation and SLRCS to oversee\nprogress against the specified activities.\nCoordination\nAs explained above, the Federation has taken the initiative to convene a widely attended national level\ninteragency coordination meeting. This is to enable all agencies, key government ministries, and the\nICRC to share assessments, coordinate sectoral responses, and plan to maximise the collective use of\navailable resources.\nAt the district level, the Ministry of Social Services has requested all agencies to coordinate relief\nassessment and distribution activities through the local government agent. The SLRCS has been\nfollowing this protocol, and local government agents have expressed satisfaction with Red Cross\ncooperation. \nThe SLRCS will continue to work closely with the Hambantota and other districts local government\nagents to ensure that there is no duplication of effort and that the most vulnerable families are identified.\nThe SLRCS has nevertheless ensured that it acts independently in the final selection of beneficiaries.\nOutstanding \nneeds\nThe initial funds raised by contributions from the Swedish Government and Red Cross, and from the\nDanish Red Cross, enabled the first 45-day distribution to be completed on time to targeted families as\nper the original plan of action. Further hard pledges from the Norwegian Government, Norwegian Red\nCross, Canadian Red Cross and CORDAID have enabled the Federation and SLRCS to underwrite the\nprocurement of food items in a phased manner to provide the six weekly rations required by 3,716\nfamilies through the six month cycle.\nThe Federation continues to appeal to donors for the full original amount to be able to scale up its\nresponse to the intended 6,500 families, even though it can currently address the needs of 3,716\nfamilies. Soft pledges had been received earlier from a few other National Societies, but there is an\nurgent need to mobilise further funds to enable the further distributions to take place for the next three\nmonths to the projected 6,500 families in total.\nThe Spanish Red Cross had made a bilateral donation of approximately Euros 12,000 to the SLRCS\nand this has been utilised in the second distribution earlier in Suriyaweva. The SLRCS will be reporting\nbilaterally to the Spanish Red Cross on the successful completion of that distribution.\nFor further details please contact: Charles Eldred-Evans, Phone : 41 22 730 4320; Fax: 41 22 733\n03 95; email: eldred@ifrc.org.\nAll International Federation Operations seek to adhere to the Code of Conduct and are committed to\nthe Humanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards in Disaster Response (SPHERE Project) in\ndelivering assistance to the most vulnerable.\nappeal no. 25/2001: Sri Lanka: Drought\noperations update no. 2\n7\nThis operation seeks to administer to the immediate requirements of the victims of this disaster.\nSubsequent operations to promote sustainable development or longer-term capacity building will\nrequire additional support, and these programmes are outlined on the Federation\u2019s website.\nFor further information concerning Federation operations in this or other countries, please access\nthe Federation website at http://www.ifrc.org.\nHiroshi Higashiura\nHead\nAsia Pacific Department\nPeter Rees-Gildea\nHead a.i.\nRelationship Management Department\nappeal no. 25/2001: Sri Lanka: Drought\noperations update no. 2\n8\nappeal no. 25/2001: Sri Lanka: Drought\noperations update no. 2\n9\nSri Lanka drought\nANNEX 1\nAPPEAL No. 25/2001\nPLEDGES  RECEIVED \n01.11.2001\nDONOR\nCATEGORY\nQUANTITY\nUNIT\nVALUE CHF\nDATE\nCOMMENT\nPLEDG\nCASH \nTOTAL COVERAGE\nREQUESTED IN APPEAL CHF ---------------------------------------->\n495'307\n87.4%\nCASH CARRIED FORWARD\nCANADIAN - RC\n25'000\nCAD\n27'235\n20.09.2001\n 0109081\nDANISH - RC\n185'000\nDKK\n37'574\n10.08.2001\n 0108127\nNORWEGIAN - GOVT/RC\n1'000'000\nNOK\n182'500\n11.10.2001\n 0110105\nPRIVATE  ON LINE\n249\n14.09.2001\n 0110033\nSWEDISH - GOVT\n700'000\nSEK\n114'590\n23.08.2001\n 0108125\nSRI LANKA - PRIVATE\n290'185\nLKR\n5'255\n11.10.2001\nDIRECTLY TO DELEGATION\nSRI LANKA - PRIVATE\n40'386\nUSD\n65'587\n19.10.2001\nDIRECTLY TO DELEGATION\nSUB/TOTAL RECEIVED IN CASH\n432'990\nCHF\n87.4%\n",
